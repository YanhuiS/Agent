🔥🔥Trump Declares His COVID Shot Was ‘INCREDIBLE PUBLIC HEALTH POLICY’ On Truth Social. WTF?🔥🔥

This is a learning moment.
You are being gaslit.

Yesterday, as Trump was traveling to a WWE, fake wrestling match he decided to post a message on his playground platform Truth Social.

Unbelievably he wrote this:

“We’re coming up on the five year anniversary of Covid, and if you recall, under President Trump’s leadership, we had incredible public health policies. President Trump’s unparalleled creation of Operation Warp Speed was one like we’ve never seen before! - Dr. Janette Neishewat, FoxNews”

Amazingly, he posted this on the same day that a major paper (establishing a causal link between Trump’s shot and death) was peer reviewed and published after being censored for over a year. The research was conducted by Dr. McCullough, Dr. Makis and a critical group of medical freedom doctors and is linked below.

This publication proves that the data is CLEAR and the shots will likely go down as the deadliest in human history. This fact, along with multiple judgements in favor of vaccine injured and public sentiment shifting rapidly makes Trump’s post VERY confusing and troubling.

Trump knows that his base HATES his vaccine.
Yet he continues to shove it down their throats.
The question is WHY?

This appears to me to be strategic gaslighting and a very troubling sign that the pivot BACK to ‘The Science’ is imminent unless we stand up and speak out as critics.

Donald Trump will be FUMING about this...

""The results from election night were disappointing, particularly in light of the last-minute absentee ballots that were dropped in Milwaukee at 4 a.m. flipping the outcome,"" Hovde said on X.

""I have heard from numerous supporters urging me to challenge the election results,"" he continued. ""However, without a detailed review of all the ballots and their legitimacy, which will be difficult to obtain in the courts, a request for a recount would serve no purpose, because you will just be recounting the same ballots, regardless of their integrity.""

""As a result, and my desire to not add to political strife through a contentious recount, I’ve decided to concede the election,"" he added.

Hovde has previously gone full Trump and questioned the election results, but now that the tally is indisputable he has caved.

Decision Desk HQ/The Hill declared Baldwin (D)  the  winner over a week ago. She pulled in 49.4% of the vote compared to Hovde's 48.5% with a margin over over 28,000 votes.

Corrupt Nevada officials might have allowed you to win here....but that's only because they can't afford any investigation into the fraud here otherwise. Clearly, something needs to be done about states like ours and Arizona.

In the most cowardly act imaginable, Las Vegas Clark County Commisioners in a meeting where only half of them showed up to face the public....illegally cut down public comment and testimony from voters and election poll watchers down to an impossible 1 minute, which made every instance of election fraud, mysteriously deleted ballots by the thousands, poll watchers being banned from watching, statistical impossibilities, the fact every important down ballot race switched to blue DAYS after the election, and people (like me) who's votes still have registered as counted all the more easier to ignore for these political parasites.

And for the second time a small radical leftist group that was working and imbedded with our elections the entire time testified against the citizens of Nevada on how there was no fraud at all, and then sprained their wrists congratulating themselves and government officials on the back for their glorious work. Can someone tell me why radical leftists are even allowed to run our elections without any chain of custody or transparency at all?

As the winner (so they can't say you're just trying to flip it) you need to send a team into all these battleground states to investigate this unbelievable fraud they've been getting away with. Once corruption has cemented itself in like this it's impossible to get rid of...because these people aren't going to just investigate and arrest themselves for fraud.

We've compiled stacks of proof over several elections...but we have no recourse here because everyone from the AG, to the SOS, to the judges are all sitting in their seats due to the same election fraud no matter the party. The Nevada GOP is just as corrupt, they've thwarted and buried every single America first candidate they've ever had...including me, I lived it.

If this country is to truly turn itself around....then it's not enough to vote en masse to beat the rig just for the presidential seat. We MUST purge fraud at the local, county, and state level to finally stop these lifetime criminals from destroying America within. 🇺🇸

@dbongino starts out his Monday Rumble show with a triumphant weekend update about his Saturday night at UFC at MSG, a gathering of Trump, several cabinet picks, and his key supporters. Bongino, talking about the gathering, said, ""Things were going down,"" an apparent reference to whether he will be picked for Secret Service director and other Cabinet business. 

He talked about how he was asked to participate in the walkout with President-elect Trump, Elon Musk, Dana White, Joe Rogan, and a bunch of Cabinet picks -- Tulsi Gabbard, RFK Jr. -- as well as Speaker Johnson, Kid Rock, and Jelly Roll: 

Sean Curran, the leader of Trump's Secret Service detail and a contender with Bongino for the USSS director job, was also working that night and was caught in an elevator selfie pick with Trump, Musk, and White. 

Here's the link:
https://t.co/UONVyeJ5GX

Bongino: 
""We were in the middle of the heart of Manhattan, liberal Manhattan, and I'm telling you...those videos do it no justice if you saw it live. Rogan, Joe Rogan...you can't even barely hear yourself talk. People were screaming, 'USA.' It was nuts. Trump was doing the dance at the end. You know, the Trump robot."" 

Then he got serious re: whether he will be picked for Secret Service director or another Trump administration post: 

""So I know a lot of you are interested in a lot of the behind the scenes about who's what... I'm just here again to repeat, none of this stuff is my decision, okay --  about anything.""

""You guys know what I'm talking about. And there's a lot to think about if that decision were to happen, and you guys will be the first to know. Because I love you, and you guys matter. And so just hang with me, you know?""

As I reported this weekend, at one point, Bongino told some Secret Service agents protecting Trump at the event, ""That help is on the way.""","Mon Nov 18 16:37:18 +0000 2024"

He tells Quaker Aotearoa (which says it all really) that it was a closely contested race. He thought Harris was “getting very big crowds” at her rallies and that Trump was getting only “modest” attendance at his rallies.
He is an Honorary Professor of the New Zealand Defence Command and Staff College, according to the university website, and provides regular contributions to the national and international media on global issues and events, like Newsroom (LOL)
He says Harris got 75,000 at her final rally in Washington DC, which is a number that came directly from the Harris Campaign and not any independent source.
By comparison, he says Trump got “modest” numbers and still believes it was a “closely contest election”. (It wasn’t)
He has a very low opinion of the next President of the United States. “Let’s be very clear,” Patman says, “Mr. Trump ran an openly racist, sexist and xenophobic campaign.”
Yet doesn’t mention any of the slurs spoken by Democrats, celebrities, MSNBC, CNN and other media against Trump that led to two people attempting to assassinate him.
Patman is meant to be an “academic” but he’s a shitty regurgitator of mainstream media bullshit.
Nothing that comes out of this guy’s mouth is worth listening to. Seriously, anyone taking his courses needs to quit them. And defence needs to up its game and find someone who can actually give it a sense of reality.
You can listen to it here, but it’s probably not worth your time.

Trump's 2024 victory was fueled by demographic shifts, narrowing traditional gaps in gender, education, age, and race. 

Trump performed better among white men, white women, and Hispanic men, while making gains among minority voters. 

His economic messaging resonated across a broad cross-section, securing all seven swing states and totaling 312 electoral votes to Kamala Harris's 226.

Safe blue states shifted heavily in Trump's favor, with places like New York, New Jersey, and Illinois showing notable changes. 

Trump's margins improved in every U.S. state, reflecting a nationwide realignment.

They will serve independently of President Trump's Secret Service detail. As women, Candace and Lynne bring a different perspective to the safety of the President; namely, a keen eye for detail and a strong intuition for picking up on emotional cues and danger. 

They both possess the physical, emotional, and intellectual attributes necessary to protect President Trump. Both are fine physical specimens in top-notch form. They're experts in several different types of Martial Arts; namely, Jiu Jitsu; Judo; Karate; Kickboxing; and Taekwondo. 

They have demonstrated their bravery; their ability to discern danger and respond quickly; and their ability to remain calm under fire. Both are graduates of MIT. They have 'street cred' and would just as soon kick your ass as shake your hand. 

They will certainly be an asset to Trump's team and will take D.C. by storm. Don't worry. You'll know them. They'll be the two female warriors kicking ass and taking names. All for President Trump.","Mon Nov 18 01:37:05 +0000 2024"
