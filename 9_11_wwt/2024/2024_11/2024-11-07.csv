As one of five State Delegations at the Republican National Convention that signed the historical documents certifying President Donald J. Trump as the Republican Presidential Nominee, Nebraska Republicans have been at the forefront of the America First movement. The 2024 General Election results are the highest voter percentage win (60.18% v. 58.22% v. 58.74%) for President Trump in Nebraska, made even more relevant in consideration to the 50,000 less voter turnout in 2024 vs. 2020.

We congratulate U.S. Senators Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts on their victories, as well as  our three House representatives Congressmen Mike Flood, Don Bacon, and Adrian Smith. Our federal delegation's support of President Trump and his policies will be a key factor in securing our borders, lowering crime, reducing government spending, and bringing common sense back to our Departments of Health and Education.

Our State-wide objectives conformed to our Legislative Plan goals and Platform beliefs. Republicans CARE for students and teachers and we gained one additional seat on the State Board of Education. We are extremely proud of all our candidates who ran for SBOE and made this their singular focus; to support teachers and ensure a bright future for our children.

There is now a true filibuster-proof supermajority in our Nebraska Unicameral as 33 Constitutional and Platform Republicans will usher in a wave of bold and purposeful policy-making during the 109th Unicameral Session.

From July - November 2024 we registered 16,000 new Republican voters and since 2022, over 30,000 new Republican voters, as the Democrats decreased by 25,000. We are actively building off these successes to implement our 2025-2026 strategy to gain more ground and further our principles. Republican values resonate with most Nebraskans and support the ‘Good Life’ that we love about Nebraska.

CNN analyst Shermichael Singleton ignited a firestorm on live TV after saying he “understands” Trump’s stance on immigration—triggering guest Michael Blake to call him out for “anti-blackness.”

Singleton then doubled down, citing a fascinating immigration study by Kamala's dad (because why not?).

University of Oregon assistant director of fraternity and sorority life, Leonard Serrato, has been placed on leave following an Instagram video in which he urged Trump supporters to ""go jump off of a f—ing bridge.""

In the video, Serrato expressed disdain toward Trump voters, sparking backlash. 

The university called his remarks ""abhorrent"" and inconsistent with its values, emphasizing its commitment to respectful dialogue. 

An investigation is underway, and support resources have been offered to students and staff.

They act like they're backing some anti-war figure who's taking a meaningful stand against the machine, when they're really backing a guy who spent four years rolling out longstanding neocon agendas.

That's what makes them so annoying. At least liberals are more or less honest about wanting to preserve the status quo; Trumpers want you to take seriously their belief that they participated in some huge revolutionary act by ticking a box for the Republican on election day. They correctly believe that their country is controlled by an unelected deep state (though they are very confused about who that actually is), but they incorrectly believe this unelected power structure can be defeated by voting for one of the two mainstream candidates presented to them at the ballot box. Like that would ever be an option.

I am really not looking forward to another four years of that shit, I'll be honest. For four fucking years these morons were in my mentions telling me every action of Trump's that I criticized was actually a brilliant 47-dimensional chess maneuver against the deep state, even when he was openly advancing some longstanding agenda of the CIA and neoconservative swamp monsters like ramping up aggressions against Iran or staging a coup in Venezuela. They warm up to me because they see me criticizing the media and talking about corrupt power structures and go ""Ooh, she's like me!"", but then they cannot understand why I keep criticizing their shitty Republican daddy figure. And then I have to spend my time explaining to them that their hero is a murderous imperialist shitstain.

And at the same time I'm going to have to be criticizing the Democrats because they'll be attacking Trump for being insufficiently hawkish on foreign policy, because that's the only foreign policy criticism you're allowed to level at a US president in mainstream politics and media, which will only contribute to the problem of Trump supporters thinking I'm on their side. It's a much less efficient and straightforward way for me to do my thing than when there's a Democrat in charge of the war machine. It's not my preferred way to operate.

Let me make things simple: if you are cheering for the US president, you are not fighting the power. You are a power-worshipping bootlicker, and you should feel embarrassed. Your president is not your friend. The US president will always, always serve the warmongering power structure you correctly feel needs to be opposed. The plutocrats and empire managers who rule your country are never, ever going to let you vote  them out of power.

Hope that helps.","Thu Nov 07 22:46:42 +0000 2024"

Disney’s Hocus Pocus 2 star Bette Midler deleted her X/Twitter account after President-elect Donald Trump trounced Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.

On Election Day, before deleting her account, Midler appeared to be coping poorly, suggesting drinking Drano in the event that Trump wins.

The actress had posted a photo to X showing a bottle of Drano clog remover with a Post-It sticker reading “Trump Wins.” next to it was a bottle of what looked to be Korbel champagne, with a sticker reading “Kamala Wins.”

As Breitbart News reported, Midler has had public meltdowns on X over Trump over the past several years.

In July, the actress freaked out over a federal court’s decision to dismiss the “documents” case against the 45th and soon-to-be 47th president, along with various other celebrities who ironically claimed the ruling represented the politicization of the judicial system.

In 2022, Midler seethed over Elon Musk restoring Trump’s X account, calling the decision “a tragic day for America” and advancing an unproven rumor that Musk emigrated from South Africa illegally.

I was dead wrong on my prediction for a Harris Victory. However, my investment portfolio is very happy that I was wrong. 

With the uncertainty of the elections behind us, stocks exploded higher to new highs with the Dow gaining 1,580 points (+3.57%) and the S&P 500 up 146 points (+2.53%). Long Bonds crashed, 10-year Treasury yields and the USD dollar spiked higher pressuring REITs prices downwards.

POSITIVES OF A TRUMP ADMINISTRATION
• Expectation of corporate tax cuts from 20% to 15%. This should boost S&P 500 Earnings Per Share by 4%
• Deregulation of the financial sector, leading to more M&A, IPOs and higher profits for Big Banks. Positive for JPM, BAC, GS etc..
• Deregulation of the Health care sector & Bio tech sector. Positive for big Pharma, managed health care stocks like UNH, ELV etc…
• Companies like ExxonMobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX) are expected to benefit from policies favouring fossil fuels, including deregulation and promotion of domestic energy production.
• Defence contractors are often seen as beneficiaries under Republican administrations. Stocks like Lockheed Martin (LMT), Northrop Grumman (NOC) could see boosts from increased military spending.
• The Federal Trade Commission will be less inclined to pursue antitrust violations & block M&As of Big tech. Positive for GOOGL, MSFT, META, AMZN
• U.S.-focused Small/mid cap companies (IWM, VBK) could benefit from business incentives and tariffs that favour domestic production.

CONCERNS (WHAT COULD GO WRONG)

• Tariffs, deportation of cheap immigrant workers, more aggressive Fed cuts could lead to a resurgence of inflation to 4% to 5%. This could spark further collapse of Treasury Bonds (TLT) and 10-year treasury yields could spike to 5%~7% & this could force the Fed to hike the Fed Funds rate again -> Bear Market
• Magnify unrealized losses on Balance sheets of banks with significant long bond exposure -> banking crisis part 2
• Increased borrowing costs will hit small/mid-caps, highly leveraged companies (i.e. real estate developers, Telcos, Airlines, Manufacturing, Financials, REITs) etc…
• Companies with pricing power, low debt and high levels of cash should be less affected in this negative scenario

 In his victory speech, Trump promised the country a ""greatest economic comeback"" and stated that God gave him a mission to ""save our country"". He also emphasized the importance of unity, saying ""It's time to put our divisions behind us and unite"".

Trump's winning speech was delivered at around 2:30 a.m. in West Palm Beach, Florida, where he was accompanied by his family and campaign team. The crowd chanted ""USA! USA!"" as Trump called his campaign ""the greatest political movement of all time"".

♻️ Some key points from Trump's victory speech include:

❇️ Economic Comeback - Trump promised to deliver the ""greatest economic comeback"" for the country.
❇️ Unity -  He emphasized the importance of unity, saying ""It's time to put our divisions behind us and unite"".
❇️ Divine Intervention - Trump believes that God saved his life for a reason, which is to ""save our country and restore America to greatness"".

Trump's victory marks a significant shift in the country's politics, with Republicans gaining control of the Senate and potentially the House of Representatives.

💹 US Stock Market News Update

U.S. stocks rallied sharply to close at record highs on Wednesday after Republican Donald Trump won the 2024 U.S. presidential election in a stunning comeback four years after being voted out of the White House.

The Dow Industrials, S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each ended at record levels, with investors expecting lower taxes, deregulation, and a U.S. president who is not shy to weigh in on everything from the stock market to the dollar, although fresh tariffs could bring challenges in the form of a higher deficit and inflation.

The Republican's win powered a rally in so-called ""Trump trades,"" sending U.S. Treasury yields sharply higher, with the benchmark 10-year note yield hitting a four-month high of 4.479%. Bitcoin hit a record high of over $76,000, and the dollar was on track for its biggest one-day percentage gain since September 2022.","Thu Nov 07 02:47:15 +0000 2024"

The 2024 election reveals a seismic shift in presidential politics—surface-level charisma and scripted appearances no longer suffice. 

Voters now demand candidates spar with bigger minds in long-form conversations with influential voices like Joe Rogan, Tucker Carlson, and Lex Fridman, exposing charlatans almost immediately.

This paradigm shift showed in the results: Harris's celebrity-backed, carefully managed campaign faltered against Trump's willingness to engage in marathon discussions on platforms where authenticity can't be faked. 

The message is clear—modern voters seek substance over style, demanding leaders who can withstand hours of unscripted scrutiny rather than minutes of polished soundbites.

I can't recall any Trump supporters threatening to harm themselves if Kamala was elected, can you??? 
If you can't see how unhinged they are then something is wrong!!! I would have been extremely upset and depressed but as far as doing something stupid.... A Democrat called into Washington journal this morning and she voted for Trump because Kamala was lying. I wonder how many Democrats voted for Trump??? That tells me some cheating went on, but it was too big to rig!!! I can't say I blame her 🤣
There's no way in hell I would have voted for her or Biden because I'm not a dumbass!!! Keeping real one day at a time!!! I can't stand liberals and my sister is one, needless to say I don't claim her!!! They hate Trump so bad that they would jeopardize everyone to get their way!!!

It will be difficult and politically unpopular to make cuts here.

Tariffs: Higher CPI, stronger us domestic growth in specific sectors, weaker global growth.

Layout the plan to deport every single illegal immigrant that entered the country under Biden/Harris.

2) Lift restrictions on US energy production, including fossil fuels and renewable energy. 

Place Elon as the Deputy Secretary of Energy and allow him to clean up the debacle that is our DoE.

3) Reinstate deregulatory rules such as “two-for-one” and reverse any Biden regulatory policies that inhibit businesses.

Place RFK Jr. as the Secretary of Health and Human Services and allow him to clean up the NIH, CDC, FDA, FEMA, and USDA.

4) Eliminate DEI from the Department of Education and begin the processes for dismantling the entire department to return education to the states and private sector.

5) Withdraw from anti American international agreements and implement America First foreign policy.

6) Rescind any Biden/Harris health related mandates and announce strict enforcement of new Department of Health and Human Services guidelines that will highly regulate big pharma.

7) Prioritize EOs that support and enhance benefits for Veterans.

A French trader, who calls himself “Théo,” ignored traditional polls and instead used “neighbor surveys,” which ask people who they think their neighbors will vote for.

He believed these polls reveal hidden support for Trump, especially in key states.

Beyond predicting Trump’s win, Théo also bet that Trump would win the popular vote—a long shot in the eyes of most pollsters.

His analysis even led him to correctly call the swing states that Trump would carry.

So, Trump won the Presidency, and the first thing some of his supporters who follow me thought to do was to tag me and make sure I felt the pain of “taking an L” while they celebrate their “win.”  Apparently some folks think he will merely be their President; or do they know something we don’t?   Nevertheless, the last 30+ hours have actually been pretty somber in our household, and have lead to some heartfelt conversations between my wife and me.  This election revealed way more about America than who won.  In an effort to make sure they re-elected a White man, who’s a silver-spoon heir to a fortune, proven liar, narcissist, thrice married, serial adulterer, adjudicated sexual assaulter, and 34-count convicted felon, who will literally say or do any vile thing publicly, he and his supporters attacked a well-educated Black and Indian woman, who worked her way from humble beginnings, through all 3 branches of the United States Government.  They trashed her with as many lies and false narratives as they could conjure up, while calling her every vulgar name possible.  They even convinced many Black people that she wasn’t Black enough for being raised by her Indian mother… and that she wasn’t loyal enough for marrying a Caucasian man and selecting a Caucasian running mate.  To top that off, knowing that enough folks are too ignorant or lazy to fact-check them, they convinced people that she’d done nothing in public service for Black people, and didn’t have a plan to do anything for anyone!

Now, relative to what she’s done, it’s not that hard to research and find that during her time as a DA and AG Kamala literally helped transform the Judicial system in California for the benefit of all, but in particular the exact Black men who were conned into thinking she unfairly targeted them.  She also did her job as a prosecutor of criminals, as she should have.  But, in the process, she put together a rehabilitation program for those in the “system,” helped reduce recidivism, and out of all the false narratives on the number of Black men she jailed for marijuana, only 2 actually served any jail time at all.  Furthermore, Kamala actively put together an opportunity agenda for Black America, along with a very detailed plan of her proposed policies for the betterment of America, while Trump is still unable to even articulate the “concept of a plan” to replace the ACA that he promised his supporters would occur way back during his first term.  Simply put, if you switched the resumes of these two former Candidates, Trump would’ve won by the largest landslide in the history of Presidential elections with her resume, except for the fact that she would’ve never even made it to the ballot with his resume!  So, I wonder are his supporters that ignorant, or do they just think we are?

In sum, she has been just as unappreciated for her hard work for us as the millions of other women in this Country who would dare challenge the power position of the White man!  Yet she has persevered on as a successful public servant, while being unfairly dragged through the mud with false narratives!  I share in the tears my wife has shed over witnessing this over the course of this campaign and the culmination of America’s reckoning.  Yes, we may have made some progress over the last several decades, but the same White Supremacist Strongholds that were birthed within its inception continue their toxic infection today… Patriarchy, misogyny, homophobia, racism, elitism, and xenophobia are still rallying points in this Country under the guise of some form of moral superiority, or in other words, White Nationalism.  White Evangelicals remain a huge faction of the supporters of all of the above.  America has again revealed her true face, and it is an ugly sight!  WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO!

THANK YOU for your valiant effort and all you’ve done VP Kamala Harris!🫡

🔹 Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand from New York and Republican Sen. Ted Cruz from Texas, both strong supporters of crypto, also won their races handily.

🔹 Bipartisan Support: Pro-crypto candidates were elected on both sides of the aisle, showing crypto’s growing appeal across political lines.

🔹 Rejection of Anti-Crypto Stance: Politicians like Senator Warren and Gary Gensler, who targeted crypto, saw their influence diminish as voters chose economic freedom and innovation. (Unfortunately, Sen. Warren was reelected, but Trump has promised to fire Gary Gensler).

Roughly nine years ago, many Democrats self-deleted themselves from relationships with family and friends. It was all because they couldn't handle that their loved ones were now Trump supporters. Dem sons and daughters left behind MAGA parents, taking grandkids with them. Dem friends ended lifelong relationships with MAGA friends. It was one-sided, Dems abandoned MAGA. It was painful and shocking, but life went on. Now that President-Elect Donald Trump has obliterated Kamala Harris those same Dems could be re-inserting themselves back into our MAGA lives, but not to apologize.

Look at this.

Persuade?

Maddow and many others in media have spread many lies about Trump and his supporters for almost a decade now. If we didn't buy your lies then, we certainly aren't going to buy them now.

No one wants this manipulative nonsense.

It might be different if Maddow and Dems were to apologize. There could be a sliver of a chance that some MAGA folks would let them back in. But this Borg approach ('You will be assimilated') will go nowhere.

For many, Dems simply did too much evil to say 'let bygones be bygones'.

Some things can't be undone. Maddow and her Democrat Party called average Americans Nazis, fascists, racists, and garbage - all because they disagreed. Dems still believe you're a Nazi, but think they can re-educate you and turn you into a 'good' Democrat.

No thanks, Dems!

According to The New York Times, Trump didn’t actually win—he just “harnessed anger and frustration.”

Kamala’s campaign was just a “victim of circumstance.” 

Trump’s? 

Apparently, a fluke.

They chalk up his historic comeback to “grievance politics” and claim Kamala simply couldn’t break through with her “populist message.”

But here’s what the Times doesn’t want to admit: 

Trump defied every conventional rule they hold dear. 

Despite every attack and obstacle, he connected with millions, rallied record donations, and even got young, diverse voters energized. 

The Times wants to call it “grievance,” but maybe it’s just what America wants.

Liberal women have sworn to go on sex strike over Donald Trump’s election win.
Mr Trump swept to victory in Tuesday’s presidential race that Democrats cast as a referendum on abortion rights and protections for women.
Some women are now threatening to punish men for voting for Trump, taking inspiration from a Korean feminist movement that vows to withhold sex from men in order to redefine the gender power balance. Interest in the “4B movement” spiked since Kamala Harris’s defeat, with women sharing videos of themselves on social media pledging to commit to its four “no’s” — no sex, no dating or marriage and no having children with men — for the next four years.
In one video shared on TikTok, a young woman pledges to go celibate and encourages others to delete dating apps in order to “exercise sovereignty” over their bodies. “As a woman, my bodily autonomy matters and this is my way to exercise sovereignty over that,” she says.
“So I highly encourage any other women who are single and still care about progressing women’s rights and still fighting for our bodily autonomy to do the same. Delete your dating apps.”The woman also encourages others to seek out their female friends for comfort “if you need somebody to cuddle” and describes the 4B movement, which originated in South Korea, as a “point of inspiration”.
The US election revealed a gender divide in the electorate, with 55 per cent of men turning out for Mr Trump and 53 per cent of women voting for Ms Harris.
The president-elect touted his role in overturning Roe v Wade, a ruling that ended the nationwide right to abortion, throughout his election campaign and has been repeatedly accused of making offensive comments about women.
In response, some have blamed sexism for America’s decision to return Mr Trump to the White House. “Men will always be against women,” read the caption in one TikTok video of a young woman crying in a car, encouraging women to join the 4B movement. “Women are just as capable to be presidents as a man.”In another video, a woman says that “for the next four years I am going to abstain from sex with men”.
A separate video was captioned: “I think it’s time for American women to participate in our own 4B movement.”
Many of the videos addressed concerns over abortion, which was on the ballot in 10 states and was central to the Harris campaign.
“If men won’t respect our bodies, they don’t get access to our bodies,” one woman said. “All I have to say is, good luck getting laid. Especially in Florida, because me and my girlies are participating in the 4B movement.”","Thu Nov 07 21:42:09 +0000 2024"

No one, not even Trump will be exempt from scrutiny because the stakes are WAY to high.

The technocratic, digital prison agenda is expanding and we must now organize for REAL reform. Today, we pivot quickly to the business of controlling our new political ‘leaders’ and shaping their agendas to OUR WILL.

The Will of The People.

What do we demand? Smaller federal government, an end to the fiscal madness, a reckoning for the COVID democide, an end to the endless wars and a return robust local control and individual liberty.

Basically … we need to get back to the original framework of our American government which was clearly laid out in our Constitution. Early American society enjoyed a very small, VERY limited federal government with robust local governments addressing social and economic needs, closest to the people. It makes a lot of sense and it WORKS.

We start with a blockbuster policy report from Catherine Austin Fitts of The Solari Report, laying out a powerful agenda for the first two years of the Trump presidency.

It's time to get tough.  @solari_the

""Our analysis has shown that TSLA should be relatively indifferent directly to most policies discussed in our recent election note, but may benefit from a shift to a federal regulation of autonomous vehicles/full self-driving (FSD) nationwide.

In addition, it is difficult to judge how Elon Musk’s increasingly close public relationship with President Trump could benefit Tesla, but this needs to be monitored closely.

We believe these factors, and potentially others, should support TSLA’s growth trajectory and thereby the higher earnings multiple.

The Biden administration has initiated several investigations into Tesla's FSD system, and there is an expectation of less aggressive scrutiny under Trump's leadership.

Elon Musk has advocated for a national standard for self-driving vehicle regulation, which the Trump administration appears willing to consider. This could facilitate the deployment of Tesla's Robotaxi service, slated for launch in 2025, which currently requires individual state approvals.

Moreover, President-elect Trump's inclination to ease environmental regulations may reduce the urgency for incumbent automakers to transition from internal combustion engine vehicles to EVs. This scenario could enable Tesla to strengthen its dominance in the U.S. EV market, particularly as it plans to introduce new, more affordably priced models.

Also, a tougher stance on China by the Trump administration may limit the entry of potential Tesla competitors into the U.S. EV market.""","Thu Nov 07 13:22:13 +0000 2024"
