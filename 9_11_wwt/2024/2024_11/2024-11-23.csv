• Women “dying” because of abortion bans? Total scare tactic. Emergency care for miscarriages isn’t abortion, and red states still provide it. Try again.

• January 6? A riot, sure, but spare me the “deadly insurrection” melodrama. Funny how leftist riots burned cities for months and somehow didn’t count as terrorism.

• Trump’s your favorite punching bag, but adjudicated rapist? Convicted felon? You’re just throwing out buzzwords hoping something sticks. Meanwhile, your party’s championing people who don’t even know what year it is.

- Donald Trump did not win this election in a “landslide”. He does not have a “mandate”. He won by one of the smallest margins in our history.

- Women are dying in red states with abortion bans because they are being denied the miscarriage medical care they need.

- January 6 was not peaceful, it was not patriotic, it was not legitimate political discourse or a tourist visit. It was a violent and deadly insurrection.

- Donald Trump is in fact an adjudicated rapist, a business fraud and a convicted felon. Just because he is now shielding himself behind the presidency, does not make any of that less true.

Now, I know that facts are about as useful to you as a dictionary, a truck that don’t have Nutz™, and a cousin-less dating pool, but they are nonetheless true.","Sat Nov 23 22:37:19 +0000 2024"

Like, historically tight. Third smallest since 1888? Not exactly a landslide moment, right? What’s even crazier is he didn’t even hit 50% of the vote. Just shy at 49.94%. That’s... awkward. But hey, it worked. He beat Kamala Harris by about 2.58 million votes, which sounds like a lot until you start comparing it to other elections.

I mean, let’s talk about those razor-thin margins in history. 2000? Bush and Gore? That one was *chaos*. Bush lost the popular vote by 0.51%, but thanks to the Electoral College and a whole mess of Florida drama (hanging chads, anyone?), he ended up in the White House. Or how about 2016—Trump again. Lost to Hillary by 2.09% in the popular vote, but the Electoral College came through for him, too. And then there’s 1960, JFK vs. Nixon. A 0.17% margin? That’s basically a rounding error.

Now, compare all that to more recent elections like Biden in 2020 (+4.45%) or Obama in 2008 (+7.27%)—those are *clear* wins. No question. Trump’s 1.68%? It’s a squeaker. But here’s the kicker: he still managed to scoop up 312 electoral votes. That’s wild. It’s one of the smallest winning margins since 1900, but it still counts. Electoral College for the win... or, depending on your perspective, the controversy.","Sat Nov 23 22:09:05 +0000 2024"

Trump’s incoming border czar Tom Homan isn’t pulling punches. 

He vows to use shock and awe as a deportation strategy.

But let’s be clear—this isn’t standard policy language; it’s psychological warfare. 

The goal? A blitz of decisive action that makes crossing the border feel impossible and pushes others to self-deport.

Homan must of did the math. A sustained deportation campaign isn't tenable. This isn't the 1950s. What Eisenhower did can't be duplicated because of social media. By the time the stories come out public sentiment will soften.  

Homan clearly knows the stakes: you either get branded or labeled (low energy Jeb flashback).

By leaning into “shock and awe,” he’s branding himself as the enforcer, leaving no room for ambiguity.

Will this strategy stop illegal crossings—or create backlash?

What do you think of Homan’s bold approach?","Sat Nov 23 13:54:31 +0000 2024"

China is urged to counter by opening its economy further to gain leverage in the US-China rivalry.

Tariffs? Likely. 

But a war? “Trump doesn’t actually want that,” the adviser notes.

In ~ two months, the rubber hits the road, and we need to see actual policy take form. It might surprise you to learn this, but campaign promises don't always materialize. 

I think the marked fib will be a major level and perhaps our first pullback. Into 2025, we're looking at uncertainty as Trump takes office and his ability to get a Bitcoin reserve passed. This will produce down/chop. IMO as details are ironed out. + Holidays can be low volume. 

The good news: 
- The ETF slurp fomo is strong, approaching Satoshi stash size. 
- Institutions are buying hand over first with seemingly no regard for price
- Traditional topping metrics aren't even close to signaling 
- Trump Admin + Congress are the most pro-crypto we've ever seen. 
- It's still early in the cycle (compared to others) 
- Fed has barely begun to cut
- ETFs have removed unit bias giving smaller investors a path to own. 

The bad news:
- Normie Retail is here and horny 
- We're getting rich fast (always concerning) 
- We don't know how much pro-crypto legislation Trump will be able to get done. Any large shortcomings in delivered promises will create volatility. 
- Market confidence is at ATH and that never lasts forever

Flores called 90% of Trump supporters “racist” and compared their red hats to “white hoods for the KKK” in an Oct. 28 Facebook post. Many protesters wore the iconic “Make America Great Again” hats as they intensified calls for her resignation following President-elect Donald Trump’s 2024 election victory. “Well, what this is, is showing that yeah, we’re wearing red hats, but we are not members of the KKK,” Kimberly Hunter, a Trump supporter, told WJET. “It’s okay to think what you want to think and post what you want to post, but when you’re an elected county official or a city official, you are held to a much higher standard.”
Outraged community members took the podium to denounce Flores’s claim that “about 90%” of Trump supporters are racist. Some attendees wore shirts that read, “Red Hats, Not White Hoods.”
“I just think it’s disgusting because when she is calling people who wear red hats the KKK without actually getting to know us, without taking the time to talk to us and get our positions. It’s actually racism,” Andrew Carson, a retired federal law enforcement officer, said of the city council president.","Sat Nov 23 14:57:28 +0000 2024"

There is more to this than just him being a liar.

I was working with the GOP when they decided they'd rather tank a couple of election cycles and lose with big government candidates than win with Republicans who were serious about limited spending and freedom on personal life choices.

They took funding from our popular, small government candidates who were dominating the polls and gave it over to big government candidates who stood no chance.

Ever wonder why elected ""liberty"" Republicans tend to fall in line or find the door? Even the best of them will take earmarks, vote for war, or support invasions on privacy. This is why.

Without the support of your party, you are completely hosed (as Libertarians got to find out this cycle). And the GOP will take your funds, challenge your signatures, and intentionally lose races before allowing a genuine and consistent small government Republican to win.

Yes, there is indeed some crow to eat for trusting one of the worst liars in political history with a record of betraying business partners.

The DNC does this as much as the Republicans too, by the way. I just hardly have to argue this since they keep having leaks about it.

We need to understand that even if a more convincing Republican or Democrat makes these offers, unless you get SPECIFIC DEMANDS and IN NOTARIZED WRITING, with DOCUMENTED CONSEQUENCES FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY, you're basically just agreeing to sell out for a quick dinner and a photo op if you make these kinds of deals.","Sat Nov 23 13:33:04 +0000 2024"

Trump spokesman labels ruling as a 'decisive win' for president-elect

Judge Juan Merchan on Friday granted President-elect Trump's request to file a motion to dismiss the charges in New York v. Trump and removed the sentencing date for the president-elect from the schedule.

Merchan said Trump attorneys have until Dec. 2 to file their motion for dismissal. Merchan said Bragg has until Dec. 9 to respond.

Merchan also confirmed the stay in sentencing for Trump, which was requested by both Trump's and Bragg's attorneys. The sentencing was scheduled for Nov. 26, but on Friday, Merchan said that date ""is adjourned.""

Trump spokesman and incoming White House communications director Steven Cheung reacted to Merchan's ruling on Friday, telling Fox News Digital it is a ""decisive win"" for the president.

""In a decisive win for President Trump, the hoax Manhattan Case is now fully stayed and sentencing is adjourned,"" Cheung told Fox News Digital. ""President Trump won a landslide victory as the American People have issued a mandate to return him to office and dispose of all remnants of the Witch Hunt cases.""

Cheung added, ""All of the sham lawfare attacks against President Trump are now destroyed and we are focused on Making America Great Again.""

In a letter to Merchan on Wednesday, Trump defense attorney and now-nominee for Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche demanded the case against Trump be tossed.

""On November 5, 2024, the Nation’s People issued a mandate that supersedes the political motivations of DANY’s ‘People,’"" Blanche wrote. ""This case must be immediately dismissed.""

Blanche said that ""immediate dismissal of this case is mandated by the federal Constitution, the Presidential Transition Act of 1963, and the interests of justice, in order to facilitate the orderly transition of Executive power following President Trump’s overwhelming victory in the 2024 Presidential Election.""

Blanche’s pre-motion letter on Wednesday was sent in order to request permission to file a motion to dismiss by Dec. 20 and to request a stay on all deadlines, which Bragg and New York prosecutors had agreed to.

The letter came after Bragg sent a letter to Merchan on Tuesday requesting a stay on the case until 2029. Bragg said he would oppose Trump’s motion to dismiss but said he would be open to receiving the defense argument.

Blanche argued that Bragg ""appears to not yet be ready to dismiss this politically-motivated and fatally flawed case, which is what is mandated by the law and will happen as justice takes its course."" Blanche pointed to Bragg’s own election campaign for another term as Manhattan district attorney.

Blanche argued that ""continuing with this case would be ‘uniquely destabilizing’ and threatens to ‘hamstring the operation of the whole governmental apparatus, both in foreign and domestic affairs.’""

""The Court must address these new issues and dismiss the case, prior to issuing a decision on the previously filed Presidential immunity motion,"" Blanche explained. ""Any other action would obviously violate the presidential immunity doctrine and the Supremacy Clause.""

Blanche added that ""even if the Court were to wrongly deny the new interests-of-justice motion, which it should not do, the appropriate forum for any additional proceedings must first be resolved in President Trump’s removal appeal.""

Blanche said that if the court denies any aspect of relief, including by moving forward with any proceedings, Trump would request that the court stay the implementation of the ruling so that President-elect Trump has ""adequate time to pursue appellate review.""

Trump pleaded not guilty to 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree stemming from the yearslong investigation related to alleged hush money payments run by the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office. Former Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance initiated the investigation, and Bragg prosecuted Trump.

I don’t want to hear a single word or excuse about why President Trump and congressional Republicans can’t make the NEEDED spending cuts to the federal budget because “we have to win in 2026!”

First of all, it’s not a guarantee that the GOP will even “win” that cycle considering that historical trends always have the party out of power gaining ground particularly in Congress.

Also whether the blame is rightfully or wrongly placed at the feet of Trump and Republicans or not, it doesn’t matter because they will have had a trifecta for 2 years and with a possibly economic collapse, they will be caught holding the bag.

So Trump and congressional Republicans need to make MASSIVE spending cuts to individual and corporate welfare which is the bulk of the budget outside of Social Security and Medicare which I can understand that Republicans don’t want to cut for political reasons which I think is fine but the other stuff I mentioned? No excuses.

There’s not going to be an easy 2 year fix. These spending cuts are going to be very politically unpopular but it’s what MUST be done to steer our country back on the right track and not towards an economic collapse.

You will not be able to drill, tax cut, cut regulations your way out of this inflation, national debt, and deficit spending.

Not only that but certain government agencies like Education, Labor, and Homeland Security need to be abolished as they are part of wasteful spending but other departments like Agriculture need to be relegated to the individual states and their agricultural departments if they have one.

No more political slogans of MAGA, MAHA, or whatever. It is time to govern. It is time to be uncomfortable and hold Donald Trump and Republicans accountable to pursuing and enacting an economic agenda that will long term, put our country in a better place and stop worrying about the next election.

The fight goes on every day and not just every 2 or 4 years when there’s an election.

Time. To. Govern.","Sat Nov 23 09:59:42 +0000 2024"
