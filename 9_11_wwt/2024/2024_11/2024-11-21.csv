He might be a huge liability for Trump and his agenda

Republicans used the death of a young woman, Laken Riley, to very effective prosecute their case against Biden’s border policy

Dems will similarly place the death of every unvaccinated child on Trump and his selection of RFK Jr and the vaccine skepticism he promotes

We’re talking about nonstop coverage of the mothers of dead toddlers talking about how they didn’t vaccinate their child because they listened to RFK jr

And statistically speaking, this is going to happen far more often than the murder of young women by illegals

I’m telling you this is going to happen because that’s what I would do if I was a leftist journalist

It’s easy to predict…this is 100% going to happen if RFK Jr is confirmed regardless of what his policies or rhetoric might be

There is simply already far too much video evidence of RFK sounding like an antivaxxer for them not to be able to credibly pin it on him and Trump

I like his agenda, but I fear he’s going to be an albatross to Trump and his larger agenda

Agree or disagree…I’m not being emotional about this.  I happily endorsed RFK jr…I think he’ll be a much needed disruptor to the public health system

But there is nothing more poignant for the masses and for the media to exploit than dead unvaccinated children…it’s gonna be bad","Thu Nov 21 22:37:16 +0000 2024"

I've since gone through four of the five stages of grief, and am currently between depression and acceptance. The thing about it is, while I've accepted the fact Trump will be this country's next president, I can't for the life of me accept the fact so many people - people I personally know and love - voted for him. That's  what I'm having trouble accepting.

In 2016, I was honestly shocked by Trump's election victory over Hillary Clinton. Sure, Clinton's approval rating was never exceptionally high, but Donald Trump was viewed by many as a joke of a candidate - a reality star just striving for attention. While I thought his presidency would be a disaster (I was right), I accepted people wanting a change from the status quo - a  seemingly apolitical businessman to shake up the political in Washington.

Following a lie-, drama-, and crisis-filled 4 years in the Trump White House, the U.S. voted him out, in favor of  political-veteran Joe Biden. Unlike the result in 2016, I accepted this immediately. It was a sense of relief. Biden may not have been my first choice, but good God, a toilet-paper roll would have been a better choice than Donald Trump. Still, Trump fared better on election day than polls had predicted, and it left me wondering, ""Why?"" While I could have somewhat understood voting for Trump in 2016, as he was the new face on the scene; didn't come across like most politicians; and possessed a long business background, after having to endure the painful 4 years of his first term, how could anyone in their right mind say, ""Yeah, I want another 4 years of that!""?

Now, after 4 years without Trump leading the country, we've voted for him to do so again. I'm no longer simply asking; I'm shouting it - ""WHY?!?""

All I can come up with is this: ignorance, prejudice, disinformation, fear, greed, and Stockholm Syndrome.

There are links between several of the aforementioned terms. For example, Trump has been quite successful in prompting fear through prejudice and taking advantage of ignorance via disinformation. At the end of the day,  though, it's like this. The rich control everything. Whether it's out of ego, greed, or a combination of the two, they can never have enough. They want more. More houses, more cars, more power, more control. So, what better way to accomplish this than to influence elections? After the Supreme Court's Citizen's United ruling, there were no longer any caps in place on monetary political contributions by those at the very  top of the economic ladder, and they have taken full advantage of it. They have aided Republican politicians in airing egregiously asinine ads ubiquitously. Their reason? Republicans want to cut their taxes, while  Democrats want them to pay more. That's it. That's the only reason. Unfortunately, the constant barrage of fear- and prejudice-inducing disinformation is incredibly effective. It plays on misinformed voters' emotions, and especially when one is ill-informed, what one feels is  much more impactful than what one thinks.

The spread of disinformation makes COVID look like polio in the modern age (well, unless RFK, Jr. leads the Department of Health and Human Services) -  it's everywhere and can't be stopped. From social media to cable news to videos to emails to commercials and beyond, it has now become a shadow of humanity. A significant percentage of the population now believes  photoshopped images and edited video clips over fact-checkers of said disinformation. Sadly, this is the era in which we currently live. The question is, how do we reverse these severely detrimental trends? Is there a way? Live fact-checks, not mandating bothsiderism so that debunked conspiracy theories receive as much air-time as facts, and not mincing words would all be helpful.

There is one commonality, amongst Trump's supporters, I feel most have failed to mention, and that's what's called 'Stockholm Syndrome.' In a hostage or an abuse  situation, it is not uncommon for the victim to feel a sense of loyalty to the captor or abuser. Having closely observed Donald Trump's behavior and rhetoric since the outset of his presidential campaigns, I can't help but believe 'Stockholm Syndrome' has been a consistent, yet growing presence amongst his supporters. Trump has always been a bully. That's just who he is. He's been accused of sexually-abusing 40+ women; he's been continually derided by former employees, alleging him of maltreatment; the man speaks disparagingly about any and every demographic in recorded history. Yet he still wins over millions of voters - many of whom have been subjects of his insults. Sadly, many of these insult-subjects or simple observers to his abusive behavior feel protected by him. They feel like a bully in charge, even if they're harmed along the way, will be able to fend off even greater threats to their livelihoods. Expanding on this a bit, it's almost like a Jesus Complex. Many of Trump's supporters - due to the bullyesque persona -  view him as omnipotent, and largely because of that, they feel he can do no wrong. It's really quite amazing. Trump was documented of lying 30,573 times during his first term in the White House, yet when I bring up this fact, the most common response I receive from his supporters is,  ""Name one! Just one lie!"" I'm not kidding. That'd be like me saying, ""Michael Jordan scored 32,292 points in his NBA career,"" and being told, ""Oh yeah?!? Show me just 1 point, just 1 point he scored!"" Easiest  assignment ever.

Along with the United States' ""democracy"" possibly coming to an end, I think the most depressing part about this dark chapter in our history is the lack of opportunity for women and the lack of accountability for men. It's pretty rich so many men - young  (""alpha"") men, in particular - are now crying that their rights are  under attack. Look who they voted for! When has Donald Trump ever truly been held accountable? Sure, he was convicted of 34 felonies, but now with him becoming president, you can rest assured he won't face any serious repercussions. He's been alleged by dozens of women of sexual improprieties - even found liable for raping one woman, yet he remains a free man. I'll fully admit, politically speaking, Democrats need to do a  better job of reaching out to male voters, but let's be real here - men aren't lacking opportunity; they're lacking the privilege they once (well, and still do, in many circles) possessed, and are falsely equating that to a lack of opportunity. Stop it. On the flip-side, how do we tell our girls and young women about what just transpired? As  parents, we want to tell our kids, ""If you put your mind to it, you can do anything,"" but how can we look our little girls in the eyes and say that without crying? For the second time in three elections, we elected a  pathological liar, a fraud, a 34x-convicted felon, a Hitler-admirer, and an adjudicated rapist over a highly qualified woman. No matter how daunting it may be, picture that. A majority of voters have just told our little girls, ""We'd rather the president be a man who raped your mother than your mother.""

'MAGA' is a mental illness, a cult, and must be stopped now, before our children's futures are forever lost.

To some extent, a lot of things in DC need to be shaken up. The question is which ones, and how.

So far, proposed shake ups have created fear in the hearts of millions of people who have very little ability to fight back… From children of good people who have lived here for years, now absolutely terrified that soldiers are going to come and take mommy and daddy away … to decent federal employees who do good and needed work, now living under the threat that their jobs will be terminated and they have no idea how they will make a living  if that happens.

At the very least, we can be emotionally sober enough to consider all the ways that plans for mass deportations and massive cuts to the federal workforce could cause tremendous pain to millions of good people. If we lose our humanitarian values - our concern for other people for no other reason than that they are other people - then we lose everything.

Reasonable actions, I’ll go with of course; delirious excitement over things that could cause massive harm to decent people, absolutely not. Each and every one of us must have the spine to say no, should that occur.","Thu Nov 21 23:37:08 +0000 2024"

A special prosecutor then tried Jussie, resulting in a jury hearing evidence and convicting Smollett of the felony, and a judge sentencing him to 30 months probation and 150 days in jail. 

The Illinois Supreme Court found that Smollett’s original plea deal with Foxx must be allowed to stand- meaning that Foxx’s sweetheart deal for Smollett ended up protecting him in more ways than one.","Thu Nov 21 21:06:07 +0000 2024"

This made obvious which were the hurdles that blocked @coinbase and @RobinhoodApp from listing $PEPE $WIF $BONK $FLOKI all of which followed. The bet here was to long/buy $PEPE right after Kraken spot listing waiting for the news

Now another opportunity sits in plain sight in front of us and people seem to wait to hear it before aping in at higher prices as always. @coinbase is listing #memes IN EXACT MARKET CAP ORDER

$PEPE $WIF $BONK $FLOKI all listed within days with this exact order

Next up in market cap are $BRETT and $POPCAT 

I believe that all big cats, $POPCAT $MOG $MEW will be listed at the same time. But even if this doesn't happen and $POPCAT gets listed first as the one with bigger market cap, it doesn't really matter

$MOG and $MEW will pump equally as it will become clear that all of them get listed eventually

As @HighStakesCap once said: ""There are 2 types of traders. Those who wait for confirmations and those who take risks""

Of course everyone waits to buy after listing and the instant 25% repricing

Good luck with that 🫵😹
