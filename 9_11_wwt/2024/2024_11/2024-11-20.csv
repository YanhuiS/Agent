Allan Lichtman, often called the “Nostradamus” of U.S. Presidential Polls, has blamed the rise of disinformation and billionaire Elon Musk for his incorrect prediction that Kamala Harris would win the 2024 election. A professor at American University, Lichtman is known for accurately forecasting nine of the last ten U.S. elections. However, last week, he broke his remarkable streak by predicting that Vice President Kamala Harris would secure the 2024 presidency.
In an interview with News Nation, Lichtman explained that conservative media and Musk’s significant financial backing of Donald Trump’s campaign played a role in his flawed forecast.

“First and foremost, disinformation. While it’s always existed, its spread has now reached unprecedented levels,” Lichtman explained in the interview. “You referred to a grievance election, but much of that sense of grievance was driven by disinformation.”

He also singled out Elon Musk, owner of X (formerly Twitter), for his role in supporting Donald Trump. Lichtman noted that Musk not only appeared at Trump’s campaign rallies but also became one of the most prominent media advocates for him. He argued that Musk’s platform contributed significantly to the spread of false information on issues like immigration, hurricane relief, and the war in Ukraine.","Wed Nov 20 14:55:30 +0000 2024"

Biden’s failed foreign policy has escalated tensions, drained billions from U.S. taxpayers, and pushed the world closer to a catastrophic global conflict. His administration has prioritized endless war over diplomacy, leaving Ukraine devastated and the world on edge.

Trump’s leadership offers a stark contrast. As president, he brokered historic peace agreements, de-escalated conflicts, and maintained a strong yet pragmatic approach to global affairs. Putin’s willingness to negotiate with Trump speaks to his credibility and ability to bring all parties to the table. Compare that to Biden, whose reckless decisions—arming Ukraine with long-range missiles and now landmines—have only prolonged suffering and risked global security.

The American people voted for peace and pragmatism when they chose Trump. Biden’s warmongering legacy must end, and this moment highlights the urgency of restoring sanity to U.S. foreign policy. Ceasefire discussions led by Trump could be the first step toward de-escalating a conflict that has dragged on far too long. Peace is achievable, but only with a leader who prioritizes diplomacy over destruction. Trump is that leader.","Wed Nov 20 21:24:07 +0000 2024"

Rachel Zegler has issued an apology for her recent social media outburst, in which she raged against President-elect Donald Trump and his supporters.

Following Trump’s win in the 2024 election, the 23-year-old Snow White star took to Instagram to share her candid reaction. “There is a deep sickness in this country,” she wrote, while also declaring: “May Trump supporters and Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace.”

However, Zegler has since backtracked on her original post, admitting that she let her “emotions get the best of me.”

“Hi everyone, I would like to sincerely apologize for the election post I shared on my Instagram last week,” she wrote on her Instagram Story on Thursday (November 14).

“I let my emotions get the best of me,” she continued. “Hatred and anger have caused us to move further away from peace and understanding, and I am sorry I contributed to the negative discourse. This week has been emotional for so many of us, but I firmly believe that everyone has the right to their opinion, even when it differs from my own,” Zegler concluded. “I am committed to contributing positively toward a better tomorrow.”

The West Side Story actor’s message comes shortly after former Fox News host Megyn Kelly demanded she be fired from Disney’s forthcoming Snow White live-action remake over her anti-Trump tirade.

“Hello, Disney! You’re gonna have to redo your film again because this woman is a pig, and you fired Gina Carano for far less than this nonsense,” Kelly said on a recent episode of her SiriusXM radio show.

Her comments were in reference to Disney’s axing of Carano from The Mandalorian, after Carano had shared a social media post that appeared to compare the Republican experience in the US to that of Jewish people during the Holocaust. She has to go. I’m sorry, Disney, she has to go right now… There’s something wrong with this person,” Kelly added. “Picture this: A Broadway actress who said, ‘F Biden supporters, may Biden and Kamala never know peace.’ That person would be fired so fast it would make your head spin.”

Zegler is currently leading Broadway’s new Romeo + Juliet revival alongside Heartstopper’s Kit Connor.

The production, directed by Tony-winner Sam Gold (Fun Home), is scheduled to run until February 16, 2025, just in time for the release of Disney’s live-action Snow White remake on March 21, 2025.

Zegler’s casting of the titular princess in June 2021 was met with backlash from some people, who decried the idea of a Latina Snow White.

The Colombian-American actor later expressed gratitude for the outrage on a 2023 episode of Variety’s “Actors on Actors” series, saying she was “so thankful for those moments because they make me feel like solid Teflon.”

“That nothing can hurt anymore because they’ve said the worst that can be said,” Zegler said. “You just say, ‘Thank you so much for this. I have a lot of love in my life, and I’m very thankful.’ We get to do our work and have that speak for itself instead.”","Wed Nov 20 21:45:46 +0000 2024"

Us @GovRonDeSantis supporters need to acknowledge that we were wrong about who the better Presidential candidate was

Trump significantly outperformed downballot Republicans by a lot and I see no evidence that DeSantis or a generic Republican would have outperformed Trump

It confirms what polls were saying during the primaries where Trump was outpolling other candidates…something I found surprising back then

The Trump coalition is something that is uniquely Trump and cuts through the negative coverage we thought DeSantis could circumvent.  But in fact, his loyalists were right that DeSantis would have gotten the same treatment as Trump, but would have been less capable of deflecting it

I still love DeSantis, but there’s nothing wrong with admitting when you are wrong

Trump was the better candidate.  Republican voters were right, and we were wrong

And... Has it not proven to be true? 

He told you he is EXPOSING the deep state. 

He tells you in this clip ""Joe Biden is President at a REDUCED level""

WTF does that mean?! 

The Joe Biden administration was quite literally illegitimate.  Not real. A show.   An EXPOSURE op. 

Was Joe and Kamala not the greatest red pill, the world has ever seen?  Think. 

Trump told us about the PAUSE. ""We will see how bad they have done.""

Did he ever concede? 

People are so emotionally tied to their beliefs, that they can't see what's happening right in front of them. 

Trump has kept his promise to drain the swamp.  All while exposing their corruption at a safe consumption rate for the public.

Rachel Zegler has issued an apology for her recent social media outburst, in which she raged against President-elect Donald Trump and his supporters.

Following Trump’s win in the 2024 election, the 23-year-old Snow White star took to Instagram to share her candid reaction. “There is a deep sickness in this country,” she wrote, while also declaring: “May Trump supporters and Trump voters and Trump himself never know peace.”

However, Zegler has since backtracked on her original post, admitting that she let her “emotions get the best of me.”

“Hi everyone, I would like to sincerely apologize for the election post I shared on my Instagram last week,” she wrote on her Instagram Story on Thursday (November 14).

“I let my emotions get the best of me,” she continued. “Hatred and anger have caused us to move further away from peace and understanding, and I am sorry I contributed to the negative discourse. This week has been emotional for so many of us, but I firmly believe that everyone has the right to their opinion, even when it differs from my own,” Zegler concluded. “I am committed to contributing positively toward a better tomorrow.”

The West Side Story actor’s message comes shortly after former Fox News host Megyn Kelly demanded she be fired from Disney’s forthcoming Snow White live-action remake over her anti-Trump tirade.

“Hello, Disney! You’re gonna have to redo your film again because this woman is a pig, and you fired Gina Carano for far less than this nonsense,” Kelly said on a recent episode of her SiriusXM radio show.

Her comments were in reference to Disney’s axing of Carano from The Mandalorian, after Carano had shared a social media post that appeared to compare the Republican experience in the US to that of Jewish people during the Holocaust. She has to go. I’m sorry, Disney, she has to go right now… There’s something wrong with this person,” Kelly added. “Picture this: A Broadway actress who said, ‘F Biden supporters, may Biden and Kamala never know peace.’ That person would be fired so fast it would make your head spin.”

Zegler is currently leading Broadway’s new Romeo + Juliet revival alongside Heartstopper’s Kit Connor.

The production, directed by Tony-winner Sam Gold (Fun Home), is scheduled to run until February 16, 2025, just in time for the release of Disney’s live-action Snow White remake on March 21, 2025.

Zegler’s casting of the titular princess in June 2021 was met with backlash from some people, who decried the idea of a Latina Snow White.

The Colombian-American actor later expressed gratitude for the outrage on a 2023 episode of Variety’s “Actors on Actors” series, saying she was “so thankful for those moments because they make me feel like solid Teflon.”

“That nothing can hurt anymore because they’ve said the worst that can be said,” Zegler said. “You just say, ‘Thank you so much for this. I have a lot of love in my life, and I’m very thankful.’ We get to do our work and have that speak for itself instead.”","Wed Nov 20 21:45:46 +0000 2024"

With Republicans set to control Washington, conservative lawmakers and policy experts who could advise the next Trump administration are discussing long-sought cuts to Medicaid, the government health program that covers roughly a fifth of all Americans and makes up about 10 percent of the federal budget.

Some of the changes are being proposed as a way to pay for a law that would extend the tax cuts from the first Trump administration, most of which benefited corporations and wealthier Americans. The policies might slash funding for Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion — which added roughly 23 million people to the program — or require that many enrollees work in order to receive benefits.

Representative Jodey Arrington of Texas, a Republican who leads the House Budget Committee, told reporters last week that he favored a “responsible and reasonable work requirement” for Medicaid.

And Senator John Cornyn, another Republican from Texas, said of Medicaid, “We ought to look at whether we’re doing it the right way.” He said he supported “block grants,” in which states get lump sums, regardless of how many people sign up for the program.","Wed Nov 20 13:51:32 +0000 2024"

Relax about @RobertKennedyJr, Dr. Oz, or Dr. Bhattacharya running health policy under Trump —public faith in the system can’t sink any lower.

A staggering 70% of Americans say the U.S. healthcare system is “failing.”

Only 30% have confidence in hospitals, and a laughable 15% trust the insurance industry.

Meanwhile, the U.S. spends double what other nations do, yet life expectancy keeps dropping, maternal mortality is the worst in the developed world, and medical debt is now the leading cause of bankruptcy.

It’s hard to undermine a system that no one believes in.

Why Trump MUST Use Recess Appointments:
🚨 1: To bypass the slow Senate process and get his team in place FAST!
🚨 2: When Congress plays politics, Trump needs to act decisively for America!
🚨 3: Essential for filling critical roles with loyalists who will enact his agenda.
🚨 4: Overcome resistance from the establishment to push through needed changes.
🚨 5: To ensure that policy-making isn't delayed by political obstruction.

What the Critics are Saying:
🔊 Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez: ""Gaetz's appointment would be a mockery of justice and ethics."" 
🔊 Sen. Elizabeth Warren: ""Pete Hegseth for Defense Secretary? It's a slap in the face to our military.""
🔊 Sen. John Cornyn: ""I have concerns about bypassing Senate's role, but it's premature to discuss recess appointments.""
🔊 Rep. Nancy Pelosi: ""Trump's choices are more about loyalty than competence.""
🔊 Sen. Susan Collins: ""The Senate has a constitutional duty for advice and consent, not to be sidelined.""
🔊 Rep. Adam Schiff: ""These appointments signal a dangerous move towards unchecked executive power.""
🔊 Sen. Dick Durbin: ""The bottom line is our responsibility in the Senate is advice and consent.""
🔊 Sen. Thom Tillis: ""Recess appointments should be used judiciously, not as a blanket approach.""
🔊 Rep. Jamie Raskin: ""Forcing a recess to make appointments is straight out of a dictator's playbook.""
🔊 Sen. Richard Blumenthal: ""I can name Republicans who are against Gaetz, insisting on a proper Senate vote.""

Everbloom Design, a Memphis floral studio, has been closed down temporarily after owner Kristin Wolter announced in a video that they would not serve any Trump supporters whatsoever. This announcement was met with heavy backlash as Wolter's video became viral, prompting calls to boycott the business. Wolter has expressed contempt for Trump and his supporters in the past. ""I won't do business with people who support the president-elect,"" Wolter shared in the studio's now private Instagram account. ""It is because I need to create a safe place for me, my staff, and my family."" She soon encountered criticism and backlash for her remarks and refusal to serve Trump supporters. Wolter has been very vocal about her opinion about Donald Trump and his supporters in the past. ""Half the country has chosen racism, bigotry, sexism, and lack of compassion and decency,"" she wrote about the 2020 elections. ""The momma bear in me is angry. Because ultimately you put them in danger. You put the lives of women in danger.""Many users on social media expressed their disdain for Wolter's statements. ""Talk about sabotaging your own business,"" wrote a user on X. ""Fine with me. We boycott businesses and products we don't like as well,"" another user said. ""That's her choice.

‼️🇷🇺🇺🇦 Fighting in Ukraine could end in 2025, — The Economist
▪️""Both sides are close to exhaustion, and supporters of each would prefer the conflict to fade away. In Washington, this will become a priority for the new administration of Donald Trump,"" the publication argues.
▪️According to his assessment, the United States is running out of both money and weapons to help Ukraine, and it still needs to help Israel and Taiwan
▪️Europe has even fewer resources, and Ukraine itself cannot cope. Therefore, the likelihood of pressure to conclude a peace agreement is growing.
▪️The publication believes that Ukraine ""will have to come to terms with the loss of part of its territory"" and is unlikely to gain accession to NATO, but some possible security guarantees.
▪️""In any case, it seems at least now likely that discussions will begin in 2025, and when that happens, the fighting could die down dramatically, even to the point of a ceasefire. While the talks are ongoing, a semi-frozen conflict could emerge. Imperfect, yes, but much better than the current state of affairs,"" The Economist sums up.

I always do the most impactful thing within my power to do. It's how I built a 1,200+ person company and contributed, at least in a small way, to the LANDSLIDE re-election of President Trump. 

Today, I am taking a major step to SAVE NY and bring fun, excitement, and most importantly, PEOPLE back to my home state, which has been decimated by Democrats. 

Three months ago, I had no political plans. I spoke up, endorsed President Trump and called for an end to political hate. I was tired of the nonsense. My message resonated across the nation.

Since then, I have had a front row seat to the political world. It's a world infested with swamp creatures loyal only to the highest bidding special interest. I do not need or want their money.

President Trump is leading a change, motivating talented people to get off the bench and join the government for the right reasons. Many are joining him and inspiring others to do the same.

Now with my great Congresswoman, Elise Stefanik being nominated for Ambassador to the U.N., I am happy to announce that I am running for the seat she is vacating in NY’s 21st Congressional District.

New York’s biggest problem is that people are leaving. Having created 1,200+ jobs, mostly in manufacturing, in upstate New York, I am best qualified to solve this problem. I’ll work to do that and encourage more talented people to enter government too. 

Congresswoman Stefanik’s top priority has correctly been building a missile defense system at Fort Drum. I will pick up this critical fight which will create jobs and make America safer. I will also work to support and protect our farmers and bolster tourism to bring people to our beautiful state. 
 
I created the Internet’s best printing company and, just for fun, the best hot sauce too. Now I will work hard to become America’s best Congressman for the benefit of NY21 and beyond. 

Thank you!

Anthony Constantino 
CEO, Sticker Mule

P.S. I already deposited $2.6 million to self-fund my campaign, and free me from special interests, because that is the amount I earned on the appreciated value of my Tesla stock. Thanks, Elon!","Wed Nov 20 21:04:06 +0000 2024"
