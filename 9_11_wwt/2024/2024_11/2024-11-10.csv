UK PM, Keir Starmer, will attend France’s Armistice Day ceremony with Macron in a symbolic show of unity, days after Trump’s re-election raised NATO concerns. 

The leaders will discuss Ukraine and defense, focusing on European collaboration as Trump’s policies push for reduced U.S. military spending. 

Starmer’s presence marks the first UK leader attending since Churchill, underscoring a need for stronger European alliances. 

Plans include increased UK defense spending and solidarity as Trump’s NATO stance shakes confidence across Europe.

Democrats are finally doing something about migration.

Donald Trump’s historic re-election to the White House led to a staggering number of Americans taking the left’s meltdown one step further by looking to relocate abroad this week.

Since the president-elect’s comeback victory became official on Wednesday, the number of related Google searches jumped 1,514% percent, according to https://t.co/CkIZWbbAst.

Between Election Day on Tuesday and Wednesday, search traffic for “immigration”-related pages on the site grew by 338% — with would-be expats zeroing in on the easiest countries to relocate to, the site said.

Other pages that saw major traffic growth were more focused on specific locales — including a 375% interest jump for a guide on moving to the UK from the US and a 355% spike for a page about Ireland.

Scandinavia also appealed to distraught voters, with a Norway guide seeing 437% more attention.

https://t.co/aiU2rh0vzg saw a 336% increase in traffic on immigration pages — including special interest in the Chancenkarte, or opportunity card, which allows anyone from a non-European Union country to live in Germany for up to one year to find work.

...

Searches for “How to move to Europe” were up 1,566%, with inquires about “English-speaking countries” growing by 1,328%.

""George feels that the backlash he is getting for Kamala losing is not at all warranted. He thinks it is completely unfair to try and make him a scapegoat for her loss. He has backed the Democratic Party and invested so much time and money into them, but he is going to take a step back for now. He feels very disheartened.

When he wrote his op-ed, George did not say “Biden is not fit to be president choose Kamala”. The Democrats jumped on Kamala and within days she was the candidate. George believes that they should have taken a step back and looked at their options. That is why he did not endorse her right away.""

Boy, don't you just feel so sorry for him?

Grenell served both in intelligence and the policy world 

Secretary of State is the 3rd highest ranking position after the President & VP

Grenell served as a pro-Trump antagonist to Germany, acting national intelligence chief, was heavily involved in Trump’s efforts to bring justice to the 2020 election, and sat in his private meeting with Zelenskyy in September 

After Pompeo and Haley are out, selection continues 

Trump said in October that the “biggest mistake” was picking people who he described as “neocons or bad people or disloyal.”

And look not just as his intransigent misogyny, equally as telling is the way that everyone at the table - EVEN THE MAN SPEAKING SENSE - fall all over themselves to accomodate his bizarre beliefs.

The host clearly tries to play ""peace maker"" and gently admonishes @MrShermichael to ""please speak a little more respectfully"".

Speak respectfully?! All he said was the factual reality that ""ppl do not believe that boys should play in girls sports"". How is that disrespectful? IT IS NOT DISRESPECTFUL TO SPEAK TRUTHFULLY, even if some ppl do not like hearing the truth.

Absolutely nobody asked the misogynistic Rabbi to clarify his position. Nobody admonished HIM saying that it was disrespectful to girls to allow boys to unfairly compete against them in sports, take their spots on the team, and steal their scholarships. Nobody admonished HIM that forcing women and girls to share a change room with men and boys was disrespectful to THEM.

Why did no one ask him what, exactly, he means when he says ""trans girls""? Nobody asked him the mechanism by which boys can become girls. And if they did, and REALLY pressed him on it, it would be clear to everyone that all he means by ""trans girl"" is ""boy who says he's a girl"". 

The fact is, until we get to a place where the entire panel will uld be shitting on this Rabbi for saying the things he's saying, for erasing girls and women, correctly calling him out for the inherent misogyny of his position, than Democrats will continue to lose elections. Because ppl see what's going on, and we don't like it.

Ppl are sick and tired of this shit, we are sick and tired of privileged elitists vomiting down their luxury beliefs onto the rest of us like they're so self-evidently correct that only a Nazi or an idiot could ever disagree with them.","Sun Nov 10 17:13:50 +0000 2024"

This is the only year ever that incumbents worldwide lost every single election.  Also, see that red dot?  That's Harris.  Of all the incumbents who lost around the world, she got the most vote share.  COVID increased inflation everywhere, but Biden actually did the best job managing inflation so Harris lost by the least amount of any incumbent this year.  They should have been praised for how much worse it could have been.  But people do not care about things like that.  The headwinds were historically bad so Harris had almost no chance.

Hedge Funds Shorting Tesla Just Lost More Than $5 Billion
By Ishika Mookerjee
11/10/2024 1:00pm

(Bloomberg) -- Since Donald Trump’s election win, the hedge funds clinging on to bets against Tesla Inc. have lost billions of dollars, as they feel the fallout of the special relationship between the president-elect and Elon Musk.
Hedge funds that had short positions against Tesla between election day and Friday’s close took an on-paper hit of at least $5.2 billion, according to Bloomberg calculations based on data compiled by S3 Partners. 

They were among a shrinking group caught out, as many of their peers unwound bets against Tesla over the past four months, according to separate data provided by Hazeltree tracking the positions of more than 500 hedge funds. That adjustment of positions coincided with Musk’s endorsement of Trump on July 13.
The Tesla chief executive officer has emerged as Trump’s biggest billionaire fan. 

Musk has used his position as the world’s richest person to turbocharge Trump’s campaign, making him one of the biggest donorsof the 2024 election. Throwing his lot in with the president-elect now lines Musk up for a position of political influence, as Trump makes clear he’s planning to reward loyalists.
￼
Elon Musk with Donald Trump
Per Lekander, CEO of hedge fund manager Clean Energy Transition, says he had “a small short in Tesla heading into the election.” He’d managed to whittle the position down “quite a lot,” meaning his losses ended up being “pretty small.”
“But we have lost some money,” he said.
Since the Nov. 5 election, Tesla shares have gained close to 30%, representing well over $200 billion in additional market value. Against that backdrop, hedge funds that had previously built short bets against the company have since rushed to reverse course.

As of Nov. 6, only 7% of hedge funds were net short Tesla, down from 17% in early July, according to weekly data provided by Hazeltree. That said, only 8% are net long the stock.
￼
 Tesla has proved a dangerous stock to short, even as the rest of the EV industry struggles with headwinds spanning trade tensions, flagging consumer demand and increasing competition. In July, almost one-fifth of hedge funds tracked by Hazeltree had built bets against Tesla, only to be badly wrong-footed after the company unveiled sales figures that triggered a steep rally.

The wider EV sector, meanwhile, has lost more than 12% this year, based on the performance of the KraneShares Electric Vehicles and Future Mobility Index ETF. That follows a roughly 9% decline in 2023. By contrast, Tesla is up roughly 30% in 2024, after more than doubling its value last year.

Tesla’s performance also stands out in contrast to other stocks in the green sector. As markets digested the news of Trump’s victory, renewables stocks spanning wind to solar started to tank, amid fears Trump will live up to his promise to slash clean-energy incentives. 

Lekander says that in a little over a year from now, he expects even Tesla will feel the sting of Trump’s anti-climate policies.
Notwithstanding the connection between the president-elect and Musk, “Trump’s win is very negative for Tesla as an auto company,” Lekander said. In about 12 to 18 months, the Trump administration will “eliminate a lot of the subsidies which Tesla really has been winning on.”
Musk has lobbied for a role in Trump’s administration that would allow him to cut what he characterizes as government bureaucracy and waste. Trump quickly latched onto the idea, publicly playing with the notion of a job as “Secretary of Cost Cutting” for the Tesla CEO.

Musk’s “position of influence now is sort of a bridge between, arguably, the tech community and Washington,” said Edward Lees, portfolio manager at BNP Paribas Asset Management. 

Lees says he’s “held Tesla at various points,” without elaborating on current positions.","Sun Nov 10 21:54:48 +0000 2024"

ADA was up over 30% within a 24 hour period, outpacing Bitcoin and other major tokens, as Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson announced plans to help shape U.S. crypto policy under the incoming Trump administration. ADA reached over 58 cents (its highest since April) extending its seven-day gains to 77% as trading volumes soared from $300 million to $3.3 billion.

In a podcast, Hoskinson outlined his commitment to working with lawmakers in Washington, with Input Output, Cardano’s development arm, planning a local office to contribute to crypto policy formation under the new administration.

Based on data we are learning, this isn't a blowout Trump win. Numbers don't back it up. Not a landslide. Not a damning referendum. 

Harris didn't run a terrible campaign. In fact impressive considering she had 2.5 months and got close in a post pandemic environment where nearly every incumbent got destroyed. She did much better than Biden would've based on internal Dem polls.

Yes, she made mistakes and Dems must improve and Biden made mistakes. All true. But Dems also picked up seats in swing states and won on abortion rights and against school vouchers. 

People who had correct facts about economy, crime, immigration, inflation and trans issues overwhelmingly went Harris. Those who didn't? Trump. Her policies when presented blindly to Trump supporters were popular to them.  

People are missing the post pandemic reality, the power of racism and identity politics of Trump's campaign, the failures of corporate media and influence of right wing disinformation as major factors.

Staten Island Councilwoman Kamillah Hanks, a Democrat, is facing backlash after responding “Well said” to a Facebook post by Republican Vincent Ignizio celebrating Trump’s election win with “Make America Great Again.” 

Local Democrats criticize Hanks, suggesting she’s a “closet Republican.” 

Hanks clarified that her comment was about uniting the country and not endorsing MAGA, stressing her moderate stance and 20-year friendship with Ignizio. 

Hanks urged Democrats to focus on addressing election losses rather than her online remarks.

Struggling to understand why Trump supporters didn’t faint at his supposed ""lies""? Maybe because they’re too busy watching your precious ""fact-checking"" media twist narratives into pretzels that fit their bias. (Remind you of someone dork?)

You care about facts? Really? Where was that righteous indignation when Biden lied about everything from his college credentials to Afghanistan? 

Or when Hillary’s email scandal was brushed under the rug? 

Convenient memory loss, huh? Maybe the ""repugnance"" threshold is flexible when it suits your team.

Here’s a thought: People didn’t vote for Trump because they thought he was a saint. They voted for results, better economy, lower unemployment, secure borders. 

Meanwhile, you’re clinging to your outrage like a toddler clutching their blankie over tone while ignoring the dumpster fire your side keeps stoking. 

Guess what? People prioritize action over your virtue-signaling nonsense.

How do we reconcile it? Simple. We’d rather have a loudmouth who delivers than a polished liar who screws everything up.

On October 27th 47 started using the hashtag #TooBigTooRig  assuming he would win so big the election could not be contested. I would assume these results meet that bar perhaps.

Then we saw an increase in hashtags such as #ElectionFraud, #ElectionInterference, #VoterFraud and #StopTheSteal.

This is not happenstance, it feels like a way to crate noise in the background while others silently work to steal the election for 47.

Then Musk tweeted that our election integrity measures were insecure. Again designed to make the left feel like the right was having a meltdown while we became self assured of a Kamala victory while something nefarious was taking place.

They were creating a feedback loop of disinformation helped by the polls that seemed intentionally too close to call while secretly manipulating data that made it #TooBigTooRig 

We always hear the elections systems are safe because each state has their own systems and I fear that is why we won’t have any investigations into this election, but something is extremely off here and the Dem Party would be wise to pay for every hand count recount in the affected states rather than they tuck their tail between their legs. 

The idea that challenging the election could lead to civil war is a poor excuse. Win or lose this country is heading towards a massive break one way or another and we might as well face it head on. Do so with integrity though so we know exactly what we are fighting about. Use every recourse to see if this election stands under a microscope because right now no one believes there is integrity at this point. Now it boils down to who was better at stealing in any given election and that is not democracy.","Sun Nov 10 18:45:14 +0000 2024"

The whole point of the Senate is to frustrate the House (I kid, sort of). It’s called the deliberative body for a reason.

A lot of leftists have just now discovered Karl Popper’s  Paradox of Tolerance, which is being copy-pasted like wildfire on FB as they all post wide-eyed emojis and exclaim in regards to to the Trump win: this is what happened! We tolerated the intolerant and now the intolerant are in control. 

No. 

Leftists, you ARE the intolerant. You are members of a one-faith ideology that is built upon using the force of government to censor and punish anyone who isn’t in your cult. You ARE the intolerant, who use the word “tolerance” as a shield to spread your intolerant ideology to the mainstream. You cancel people from knitting circles and concerts and art events for not being in your belief system. You throw political enemies in prison and try to assassinate them. You leave NO room for anyone who isn’t woke. 

Congratulations for just now learning about the paradox of tolerance. The paradox of the paradox of tolerance is that YOU are the intolerant ideologues we tolerated until your woke orthodox cult owned academia, entertainment, hobby groups, churches, corporations, government and the media. At which point you censored, punished, arrested and oppressed anyone not in your belief system. 

You’re the intolerant cultists we are rejecting.","Sun Nov 10 16:36:38 +0000 2024"

'I think his supporters would be incredibly disappointed if there was not a swift, negotiated end to conflict in Ukraine, it's part of his political identity that he's against the forever wars...I know from covering his campaign in 2016 that this was incredibly important to building up his support with the working class in America. 

If you go to red states, you see so many people who came back from America's misadventures in Afghanistan and Iraq and they were so angry about so many things. That was a huge factor in electing Trump the first time and I'm sure this time as well.'

First, those individuals are not actual @realDonaldTrump supporters, nor were they arrested for the tweet by Trump regarding minority issues. (For the Indian media’s information: recently, there were celebrations in some places in Bangladesh following Trump’s victory. People even put up posters congratulating him, and none of them were disturbed or arrested.)

Secondly, today there is a protest program by ousted Awami League in Dhaka. These individuals are reportedly Awami League supporters, carried Trump's photos and posters as a shield in a politically motivated act.

In a recent audio clip that went viral across social media, AL President Sheikh Hasina instructed her party leaders and activists to carry pictures and placards of the newly elected U.S. president Donald Trump, as shields during unauthorized rallies. She reportedly advised them to capture any vandalism or insults on footage. (While I couldn’t confirm the authenticity of the audio or whether it is Hasina's or not , the directive to carry Trump’s photo was mentioned there.)

Following this directive and today’s Awami League program, these individuals were arrested last night with Trump photos. They were detained for alleged misconduct and implementing the directive conspiracy against the state.

The use of Trump’s photos was purely for political gain—they weren’t carrying his image because they support him.","Sun Nov 10 09:30:57 +0000 2024"

Whatever happens after Trump is sworn in will define not just Ukraine's future but also Europe's security and status in the world for decades. We need to act like it.

Now the essential question is what will Europe, the UK and the Biden administration do in the two months that remain. We need to surge military and economic support for Ukraine, including by confiscating all Russian assets in the west and handing them over to Ukraine, removing restrictions on the use of ranged weapons and dramatically speeding up deliveries. We need to scale up military production by all means possible - not much can be done in two months but even having plans in place will strengthen the outlook for Ukraine and free up existing inventories.

We also need to strengthen Europe's ability to enforce sanctions - removing U.S. trade sanctions against Russia would not do much as Russia is/was much more reliant on Europe than the U.S. for fossil fuel exports and technology imports, but losing U.S. enforcement would be much more harmful, as the EU and UK have relied on the U.S. on this. 

The major risk here is that Europe watches on the sidelines as Trump tries to engineer international recognition of Russia's illicit occupation, and sweeping aside of the country's barbaric war crimes. This precedent would be an open invitation for Russia to continue attacking and subjugating sovereign nations, undermining the entire basis for peace and prosperity in Europe.

The priority needs to be to strengthen Ukraine's position, give the country the ability to reject a grossly unfair deal between Trump and Putin and ultimately strengthen the country's position in any negotiations. Doing this would also ensure that Europe isn't a mere spectator when the continent's future is decided.","Sun Nov 10 14:21:23 +0000 2024"

Do you think the nationwide election fraud conspiracy won’t be exposed?

Do you know what happens when it is exposed?

The entire government is illegitimate.

What happens when an entire election is unconstitutional?

Isn’t a new election required?
Isn’t that the “remedy” that will be handed down by the courts?

Do you think Trump doesn’t know this is already coming?

While people “freak out” about who will be heading the Senate or the House, Trump knows it doesn’t matter because a new election is coming.

The democrat party is going to be toxic and the entire country will go MAGA.  

At that point…..every promise that Trump has made will come true.

After Trump’s victory, conservative women are celebrating by planning to expand their families. Illinois mom Tara Elsas, whose TikTok about having another child went viral, shared, “Trump’s pledges to lower inflation and support working families mean we can afford another baby.”

The position already exists and has done little to stop the current election fraud happening in AZ, PA, NV, CA. Her responsibilities to investigate 2020 and 2024 elections for fraud, arrest those that have committed crimes, and to provide a path forward for fair and honest election.  

If you want someone to clean up elections, it should be someone that has been screwed by the system - someone motivated.

Nearly 54% of Harris voters want to move to a different state or country following Trump's win on Tuesday

More than 50% of voters for Vice President Kamala Harris say they want to move following Trump's victory in the 2024 presidential election, according to a survey commissioned by https://t.co/MNzrriEx43.

Storage Units surveyed 1,837 Harris voters on Nov. 6 to determine how many would like to relocate – and who actually plans to – and the top concerns of those who voted against Trump.

Of those surveyed, 44% would like to move, but probably won't, while 5% said they will definitely move and another 5% said they probably will. Those who would like to move, but probably won't, cited personal finances, family and community ties as reasons they will stay in place.

Of the 10% planning to move or seriously considering it, 90% are looking into moving to another country, with the top choices being Canada, the United Kingdom and Mexico. California, New York and Colorado were the top three choices for those considering moving to another state.

According to the survey, the top three reasons Harris voters want to relocate are concerns that a federal abortion ban will be enacted, an increase in racial inequality and progressive rights will be overturned.

Abortion access at the federal level, which was one of the Democrats' top campaign issues, has been an area of concern for many Dem voters despite Trump stating he would not enact a federal abortion ban and reiterating that he agrees with the decision being left in the states' hands after Roe v. Wade was overturned by the Supreme Court on June 24, 2022.

Other top areas of concern include: reduction in healthcare access, increased social inequality, lack of gun regulation and the weakening of public education.

""​Some Harris voters who are ​​experiencing fear, anxiety, and concern ​following the election results may elect to​ shift from a red to a blue state with friendlier LGBTQ+ and/or less restrictive abortion laws. However, there are a number of factors influencing any potential moves, such as cost of living, job availability, and housing prices,"" Realtor Jo Ann Bauer told Storage Units.
