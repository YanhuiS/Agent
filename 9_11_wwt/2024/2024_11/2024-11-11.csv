Some are citing her rant as evidence of potential electoral interference during the 2024 Presidential election.

The woman's opening remarks claim she possesses a CCIE (Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert) — a very prestigious certification which is often possessed by truly dedicated people. 

Currently there are only 45,000 active CCIE holders worldwide. Only 3% of Cisco cert holders attempt it ... and only 26% pass — it has a 74% failure rate.

Now it should be stated that no one in our group possesses a CCIE. We do not claim to be network experts, we're just malware nerds. However, despite our lackluster understanding of networking (beyond the computer science basics of the OSI model), we can confidently say this woman does not possess a CCIE and we believe she is lying.

Additionally, we would like to note we did indeed watch this entire video. Despite this woman's jargon and clear ... plainly wrong information... we decided to give her a chance to speak her mind and opinion.

We do not recommend watching the entire 8 minute video. You will have no benefit from it. At roughly 4 minutes you will see, very clearly, this is not a technical person.","Mon Nov 11 23:03:03 +0000 2024"

President Donald Trump achieved a historic victory in the 2024 presidential election, securing 312 electoral votes to Vice President Harris's 226 and completing an unprecedented sweep of all seven battleground states: Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia.

This marked the largest electoral victory margin since Obama's 2012 win.

The scope of Trump's victory extended beyond electoral college votes: he secured over 74 million votes, the highest raw vote total ever achieved by a Republican presidential candidate, with a margin of approximately 4 million votes over Harris, making him the first Republican to win the popular vote since George W. Bush in 2004.

Particularly notable was Trump's performance in traditionally Democratic states like New York and California, where he secured 44% and 40% of the vote respectively, marking improvements of 12 and 6 points from his 2020 showing.

President Trump addressed supporters after the race was called, outlining his vision for what he termed would be the ""golden age of America.""","Mon Nov 11 04:25:36 +0000 2024"

Over 5,000 immigrant children were separated from their parents.

You see, white nationalist Stephen Miller crafted a  “zero-tolerance” policy.

This policy required the criminal prosecution of ALL adults crossing the border illegally, including asylum seekers. 

This resulted in children being taken from their parents and placed in federal shelters or foster care. 

They barely kept track of where these children were taken, all by design, making reunifications difficult. 

When Joe Biden took office, his administration established a task force to reunite separated families. Hundreds have been reunited, but many remain separated. 

And so it shall begin again because cruelty is always the point.

This reality highlights a critical insight: drug addiction is fundamentally a public health issue, deeply rooted in social and emotional struggles, and cannot be resolved through military action alone. Addressing the crisis requires a comprehensive approach that tackles root causes, such as trauma, mental health challenges, and access to treatment—elements that a military response would fail to address effectively.","Mon Nov 11 22:55:02 +0000 2024"

CNN, citing two sources familiar with the plans, first reported the appointment, which does not require confirmation by the Senate. Vice President-elect JD Vance said the choice of Miller, a longtime adviser who helped Trump craft immigration policy and speeches, was ""another fantastic pick by the president.""

During Trump’s first term, Miller advocated for the separation of migrant children from their parents as a deterrent for illegal immigration, as well as a travel ban targeting refugees and visitors coming from a handful of majority-Muslim countries.

After leaving the White House following Trump's 2020 election loss, Miller founded a conservative nonprofit group, America First Legal Foundation, that he called ""the long-awaited answer to the ACLU"" (American Civil Liberties Union).

Miller said in an interview with the New York Times earlier this year that ""Trump will unleash the vast arsenal of federal powers to implement the most spectacular migration crackdown."" As part of that, Miller said, the administration will shift from arresting specific immigrants who illegally entered the U.S. to carrying out sweeps and raids at workplaces and other public places. Because of the large number of arrests and people awaiting possible deportation, Miller said the Trump administration would build “vast holding facilities that would function as staging centers.” The new camps, Miller said, would be located “on open land in Texas near the border.”

In the same interview, Miller also said that Trump will attempt to end Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, known by its acronym DACA. The policy, first enacted by former President Barack Obama, allows undocumented immigrants who entered the country as children to remain in the U.S. if they meet certain requirements.

Early Wednesday morning, as some U.S. news organizations were projecting that Trump had won the presidency (but before The Associated Press made its call), Miller posted on social media: “CIVILIZATION HAS BEEN SAVED.”","Mon Nov 11 21:37:29 +0000 2024"

Looks like some federal employees are suddenly “traumatized” because Donald Trump is putting his loyal supporters into key roles. 🤔 Funny how they weren’t so bothered when Biden filled his administration with old pals like Anthony Blinken from the Biden Penn Center, or Ron Klain, his right-hand guy from VP days. 🤷‍♂️

These same bureaucrats had secret meetings before Trump even took office, plotting to thwart his agenda… but now they’re losing it because he wants people who will actually follow his plans to fix the country? 🤯

Isn’t it the President’s job to appoint people who support his policies? Last time we checked, that’s exactly what Biden’s been doing with his loyalist-packed team: Susan Rice, John Kerry, and countless other Obama-Biden insiders. 🤫

So, here’s a question… why the double standard? 💥 Why is it “PTSD” when Trump does it but “good governance” when Biden does the same?

I have a big proposal for you.  

Right now, we're at an unprecedented level of breaking the cancel culture stranglehold, as more Trump supporters are speaking out.  

That includes eSports competitors.   

As you may or may not know, the eSports industry revenues is projected to generate almost 2 billion dollars in 2025, and there is an untapped market of content creators willing to support a platform that will not stifle their free speech.  

However, there is still a slient majority in this industry, who have no support and are afraid of their sunk cost being disintegrated.  

I recently had a meet with @UnclePudge_ and some of your other partners about this issue.

Inspired by South Korea’s Radical “4B” movement, some American women are now saying no to dating, marriage, sex, and children with men following Trump’s 2024 re-election.

“4B” stands for (bi in Korean) or “Nos”: no dating, no marriage, no sex, and no children with men.

Launched in the late 2010s on platforms like Twitter and Womad, the movement has contributed to South Korea’s plummeting birth rate – now among the lowest globally.

I reached out to a handful of contacts to gauge the temperature, and it sounds like a night & day change. 

Responses below:

ICE officer: ""It’s a total 180, troops are finally feeling like the sun is coming out after a very long storm. People are fired up to have support. It’s amazing because we all became so numb I don’t think we realized how bad until we finally have hope again. Everyone so happy about Homan's return.""

ICE official: ""I feel that people know now they will get to do the work they signed up to do. And that they want to do. They know they can get the bad guys now. Public safety threats, national security threats, gang members, here we come!""

ICE officer: “[Morale] super high. Especially with the Homan news too.”

AZ Border Patrol agent: ""Ecstatic to go to work! Morale is even higher than the first time he won.""

CA Border Patrol agent: ""We've all been hopeful but the giveups are still trickling in. Nothing will change until Tom Homan takes the leash off us.""

TX Border Patrol agent: ""Oh dude people who were going to retire are not and everyone is happy.""

Border Patrol union also tells FOX agent morale is surging. 

Lots of excitement about Tom Homan being named Border Czar. Widely respected within Border Patrol & ICE. 

Several contacts also indicated they're looking forward to no longer having to use politically correct language, for instance, ""noncitizen"" instead of illegal immigrant.","Mon Nov 11 22:28:12 +0000 2024"

But it gets even worse...

Miller has been selected for his new role before Trump has even announced the more traditionally important picks for Attorney General, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, or National Security Adviser.

What this indicates is that Trump is far more fixated on implementing his far-right ""mass deportation"" plans than on protecting and running our nation. The suffering these men will unleash is impossible to calculate.

Vice President-Elect J.D. Vance rushed to X to praise Trump's ""fantastic pick"" because as we we all know by now, Vance is an obsequious lapdog incapable of criticizing even the worst decisions of his boss.

We're headed towards the worst presidential administration in history — but we refuse to give up. If American democracy is going to survive four more years of Donald Trump it will take every single one of us. We can't give in. We must fight on!

Kai Trump has revealed that she was moved to 'tears' over her 'hard-working' grandfather Donald Trump's win - as she shared a behind-the-scenes look at their Mar-a-Lago election party.

Kai - the 17-year-old daughter of Don Jr. and his ex-wife Vanessa - shared an inside glimpse into her family's election night festivities in a new video uploaded to her YouTube channel on Monday.

The teenager documented the moments leading up to Donald's victory against Kamala Harris, and reflected on the emotional moment that they found out her grandfather would officially become the next US President.

The vlog started with Kai getting ready for the big night, which involved her getting her hair and makeup professionally done before she switched into her shimmering, black, strapless mini dress and a pair of gold heels.

After that, Kai jumped into her car and headed over to Mar-a-Lago to join the rest of Donald's immediately family and close friends.","Mon Nov 11 20:50:10 +0000 2024"

“And this is now who is, who has proximity to power in the White House, basically number two, next to Susie Wiles in the ear of the president of the United States. Well, I guess the upside is at least he won’t be DHS secretary or attorney general.”

Jim Acosta: “Do you think that’s because they’re probably worried that he couldn’t get confirmed?” 

Setmayer: “Probably...But, you know, Trump, that’s why Trump is asking for recess appointments and they’re trying to circumvent normal institutions and processes because you’re going to find out that a lot of these people…would not be able to pass muster once they are really on public display,”

“You didn’t just vote for Donald Trump. You voted for the people like Stephen Miller, the people who gave those speeches during the fascist rally there you had in Madison Square Garden. They voted for that, too.”

If Biden isn't running the show, then neither is Trump. He isn't high enough in the global power hierarchy.

The changes he'll make will be within the acceptable range as determined by those in control.

This isn't a black pill; it's a red pill because it is the truth. This means that putting your faith in a political leader who, whether you like it or not, is not anti-establishment will invariably lead to disappointment because he will not save you (or America or the world).

For example, Elon Musk is very close to Trump and is a strong advocate of carbon taxes, electric cars, solar power, putting chips into people's heads, and surrounding Earth with a digital surveillance grid. He also appointed Linda Yaccarino, who is high up in the World Economic Forum. I recommend Whitney Webb's piece (https://t.co/32KrEFpY0O) on why Trump could introduce Sustainable Development in a sexy way that will appeal to Republicans without them realising.

Watch if Trump removes America from the Paris Agreement—that would be a step in the (far) right direction. It's just one of many things to look out for.

Just because Trump won doesn't mean Agenda 2030 has ended or that technocracy isn't advancing under a different brand.

Stay awake.

Over and over again, from the irresponsible and disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, to the appointment of perverted men masquerading as women to high government positions, to celebrating “Transgender Day of Visibility” on the day Christians celebrate the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Biden-Harris administration has intentionally and repeatedly grieved my soul as a Christian and my heart as an American.

I can’t imagine how any Christian who loves God and hates evil didn’t feel the same and does not now feel the same sense of relief to see God’s hand of mercy in giving us some reprieve from having the White House consistently rub our face in sexual perversion, godless depravity, and ongoing intentional incompetence.

When Trump left office in 2020, one of the takeaways from his admin was that they were too inexperienced and underprepared for D.C. Many in Trumpworld openly admitted this (that he failed vs. ""the deep state"") before campaign season really started. For a couple of years it seemed like their plan to fix that in a potential second term was with initiatives like Project 2025 -- essentially, policy wonking the Trump worldview and implementing it with people who had experiencing navigating D.C. Personally, I thought this was a wise reaction to the first term failures.

In the last few months of the campaign, though, something seems to have shifted. Trump distanced himself from and became disenchanted by the Heritage type conservative leader, and is now leaning into some of his surrogates as he transitions to governing; that is the Elon Musk (taking phone calls with world leaders), Vivek Ramaswamy (being talked about for a Senate appointment), and RFK Jr. types (keeps insisting he is going to have a major role in healthcare).

One initial theory that I'm operating on is that if Trump spends the first year or two of his presidency listening to people with zero government experience about how to get things done in D.C., he is once again going to waste half his term running into roadblocks, failures, and legal challenges. This would be a very similar mistake/instinct that Trump followed in 2016, which cost him pretty dearly.","Mon Nov 11 12:48:20 +0000 2024"
