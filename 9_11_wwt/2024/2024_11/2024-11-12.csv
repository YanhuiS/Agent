The Democrats will say anything EXCEPT that they lost by a LANDSLIDE!

Left-wing conspiracy theorists have claimed the 2024 US presidential election was “stolen”, as posts falsely alleging Elon Musk’s Starlink satellite network was used to manipulate the result spread on social media.
Claims that 20m votes in the election have “disappeared” or that Starlink was used to interfere with vote-counting machines have been shared by thousands of people across X, Threads and TikTok. A nine-minute video claiming states had used “Starlink in order to tally up or count ballots” had more than 100,000 likes, 55,000 shares and had been viewed almost 900,000 times on TikTok. The video falsely claimed: “This is why the numbers don’t make sense.”
Similar claims that Mr Musk, a Trump ally, may have used Starlink to tamper with the election have spread widely across Threads, the social network owned by Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, as well as on X, which is owned by Mr Musk and was previously known as Twitter.
On Threads, one post with more than 42,000 views and 840 shares claimed Mr Musk “knew who won four hours earlier than we did”.
It alleged Starlink had been “exploding” communications satellites, with Mr Musk “destroying the evidence”. Another lengthy post with more than 370,000 views and 6,300 shares claimed that voting had been hacked “at the tabulation level”. Hashtags such as “TrumpCheated” have been shared across Threads and X, while calls for recounts have been shared with the phrase “SwingStateHandRecount”. There is no evidence to support the claims spreading on social media. US voting machines are typically disconnected from the internet in order to prevent interference.
Last week Jen Easterly, director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said there was “no evidence of any malicious activity that had a material impact on the security or integrity of our election infrastructure”.
Allegations that there are millions of “missing” votes have been spread by both Democrats unhappy about Trump’s victory and Republicans who claimed the theories vindicate their concerns about the 2020 result. The discrepancy in the number of votes cast is mostly down to slow vote counting in California, which as of Monday had only processed around 74pc of ballots despite being called for Kamala Harris days ago.
Some social media posts spreading the conspiracy claims have been accompanied by fact-checks debunking the claim, such as a post on X that had repeated the Starlink claims.
On Friday, disinformation analysts at NewsGuard reported that in the hours after it became apparent that Mr Trump had won “Left-leaning social media users claimed that the apparent momentum behind Kamala Harris before the election made it impossible for her to lose, so the only explanation was widespread fraud.”
Alex Stamos, chief information security officer at SentinelOne and a former executive at Facebook, said in a post on Threads: “This election was not stolen. Neither was 2020.","Tue Nov 12 13:04:08 +0000 2024"

Viewership for MSNBC and CNN has tanked since Donald Trump steamrolled Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, an election result the two networks ensured viewers would result in the end of democracy.

Mediaite obtained viewership data from Thursday to highlight the concerns both channels face. For the day, MSNBC averaged 596,000 viewers while CNN recorded just 419,000.

That's a decline of 23% for MSNBC and 40% for CNN year over year. But the primetime numbers are even more concerning. While CNN saw a 30% decline, MSNBC declined an unprecedented 54%.

""MSNBC host Alex Wagner had her lowest rated show ever, in terms of total viewers, while Chris Hayes’s show brought in its worst numbers since May of 2016,"" Mediaite reports.

For comparison, Fox News averaged 2.6 million viewers, a 60% increase from 2023.

CNN and MSNBC's futures are bleak.

The two networks maintained relevancy during Trump's first term by aggressively promoting the Russia hoax. Though the networks could try to manufacture another phony scandal, who would believe them?

Trump's decisive victory demonstrated that the left-wing cable news networks have lost their influence. CNN and MSNBC exhausted every resource at their disposal to stop Donald Trump from achieving victory, eventually stooping to a plot to depict him as the second coming of Adolf Hitler, the most ruthless dictator in modern world history.

It didn't work. The lies, the hysteria, and the besmirchment only made Trump more popular and sunk CNN and MSNBC deeper.

And even California will shift about 10 points to the right compared to 2020. 

2. Trump will win the popular vote by 1-2% despite all his personal baggage. His platform was popular enough, and Democrats unpopular enough, to blast through January 6, convictions, and all of Trump's many self-shots to the foot. Were it not for that stuff, he would have won a Reagan-style landslide, or at least a win like Obama's 2008 margin of around 7%.

He warned against allowing Kyiv to use Western long-range missiles on Russian soil, calling such actions ""electioneering.""

Medvedev also criticized European politicians for dragging the war into their territories and dismissed Trump's possible win as a blow to Ukraine, with the Kremlin denying any recent talks between Trump and Putin.

His strategy for doing the podcasts was a large part of the win. People got to know who Trump really is and probably won over more votes that anything. 

I will say there are some additional factors that contribute to the win in my opinion: 

Scott Pressler's vote registration success in PA was key in winning that state. PA cemented the win nationwide. 

RFK Jr. partnership added millions of votes. This was a big win for the campaign because it not only added the health factor but it showed voters that we were no longer  going to let big business profit from keeping America sick. 

Elon Musk was integral because people were already angry about government spending. They get angrier when money gets tighter for the people. Too much to mention about his contributions.

Tulsi Gabbard: Another candidate that at one time ran for president as a Dem against Trump. If you watched her performance in the primaries, she was a force to be reckoned with. So much so that the DNC knew they could not let her shine next to their chosen candidate Biden. 

Vivek Ramaswamy: Another presidential contender who really shined on the debate stage and long after. I didn't know who he was at the time but he's a very capable force. I watched him at a campaign stop in Springfield Ohio during the Haitian issue where they begged him to run for Governor of Ohio. 

Lara Trump: The new sheriff in town provided the poll watchers and legal teams that kept the DNC from the cheating that happened in 2020. Had this not been done, we certainly would have lost. 

There are many other people on the team that I neglected to mention. The fact is when voters were given the choice, they had the choice between the Trump team and all of these benefits and the alternative of Kamala, Tim, and a bunch of celebrities. 

America chose wisely.","Tue Nov 12 20:22:02 +0000 2024"

- Israel: You are not going to find anyone who doesn't back the consensus on Israel, sorry. They just don't exist. Trump is literally the only guy in DC who has any freedom of action on this issue.
- Russia/Ukraine: At best, you'll find people who think it's a waste of money. I would prefer individuals who at the very least bucked the “uncritical support for Ukrainian ultra-nationalism” trend that swept the establishment.
- Iran: Max pressure is most likely coming back, but also it's been made very clear that we're not going to put ourselves on a war trajectory.
- Latin America: I actually want to see a neo-Monroe Doctrine of sorts, especially regarding the remaining communist governments in the hemisphere. Venezuela is going to be a big target for remigration.
- China: It would be nice to find individuals who have given any type of extended thought to what the hell we are going to do about this place. Literally any evidence of someone giving any extended consideration at all to the CQ is a good sign in my book.
- Japan: Greatest ally. Non-negotiable!
- UK/NATO: Same as it ever was really. Some of those governments are really important allies, but they need to pay their fair share. That being said, I can't imagine the status quo really changing.
- Australia: They need to table that censorship bill and I think they know that.
- Brazil: Regime change required. We should form an agricultural cartel with them but I don't think that's going to happen.
- Mexico: We need their cooperation on the border and I am skeptical that their current government will provide that, but I'm sure we can work something out.
- Canada: Trudeau must answer for his crimes. Also, their open borders policy has allowed a sizable number of illegals to enter through our Northern border. Not on the scale of Mexico but it's still something we need to address.","Tue Nov 12 20:33:04 +0000 2024"

I know many of you are upset at Trump's pro-war picks. You expected him to be anti-war. I hate to tell you but your favorite 'independent media' hosts were lying to you the entire time. Here's Trump's 1st term foreign policy:

- increased drone strikes 432% 
- 2,243 drone strikes in his first 2 years alone (more than 8 years of Obama)
- kept us in Iraq
- kept us in Afghanistan
- 330% increase in civilian deaths in Afghanistan
- bombed Syria twice
- bombed somalia
- occupied a third of Syria to “take the oil”
- Increased the military budget every year
- let Israel illegally annex the Golan heights (which is Syrian)
- assassinated a top Iranian commander who was fighting ISIS
- tried to coup Venezuela
- ripped up the Iran agreement
- armed Saudi Arabia as they did a genocide in Yemen and vetoed a bill to cut off the weapons
- dropped the 'mother of all bombs' on Afghanistan
- hired John Bolton, Mike Pompeo & Gina Haspel (all insane neocon warmongers) and let them run his foreign policy
- Pardoned black water war criminals
- signed pro-torture executive order
- his first military raid as president killed a little American girl

I haven't even included in this list what he SAYS he wants in his 2nd term (war with Mexico, allow Israel to annex the West Bank). Stop listening to scam artists who don't know the first thing about policy and only care about vibes.

With love,
a guy who gives a shit about policy","Tue Nov 12 18:41:14 +0000 2024"

Tom Homan is going to man the border.
The former (ICE) U.S Immigration & Customs Enforcement director is talking tough.

His two picks (Tom Homan & Stephen Miller) are hardliners. Both worked on Trump’s Family Separation Policy. They may likely sanction employers that hire illegal immigrants this time.

They will likely work alongside South Dakota governor, Kristi Noem. She is the likely nominee for the office of Homeland Security Secretary.

Nigerians should pay attention to Marco Rubio. The likely nominee for the Secretary of State. The Floridian is likely to head The State Department (DOS), & U.S Foreign Policy.

Marco’s body language will decide the tone of 2027 election to some extent. Any type of meddling will have to come from his office.

Trump values loyalty more than anything. His choice for Floridians is proof of that. You have Floridians competing with New Yorkers as his likely picks. You must be willing to carryout Trump’s agenda. But he’s got a big heart.

Trump will forgive those who campaigned against him. With the caveat that you have to be loyal this time. Marco Rubio is proof of that.

With the trio of Elise Stefanik, Mike Waltz & Marco Rubio; NATO coalition won’t have much to worry about. The triumvirate have balance; they are not the type to pull the plug on a whim.

I suspect that Marco Rubio will likely pick the nomination bcos he is hard on China. He will become America’s Top Diplomat, & carry the message of U.S Foreign Policy around the world

By & large, Trump will get most of his picks right. Especially Susie Wiles, Kristi Noem, Marco Rubio, Lee Zeldin & Elise Stefanik.

I repeat: “the U.S Dollar is at its strongest now. And Donald Trump is not in the Oval yet. Nigeria should be thinking of what to do, & quit the sponsored attacks against Peter Gregory Obi.”

You have enough mountain on the fire as it is, & Trump is yet to be inaugurated. I don’t that the combination of Wale Edun & Yemi Cardoso are equipped to weather the storm that is coming.

You will need technocrats in the caliber of NOI & Akin Adesina to survive the harmattan.

A Trump’s presidency means weak Naira. We all know that Nigeria has never taken advantage of anything. With the Naira trending around N1740 to the dollar, I hope you don’t end up at N2000.

Trump’s expected staff:

1. EPA: Lee Zeldin.
2. Border: Tom Homan.
3. Chief Of Staff: Susie Wiles.
4. Deputy Chief: Stephen Miller.
5. Homeland Security: Kristi Noem.
6. UN Ambassador: Elise Stefanik.
7. Secretary of State: Marco Rubio.
8. Treasury Secretary: Scott Bessent.
9. National Security Adviser: Mike Waltz.","Tue Nov 12 17:33:10 +0000 2024"

Anyone with a functioning brain knows it's a lie.    It's certainly possible that one or two people with Trump signs yelled at them but that's not a reason to deny aid to over half of the people that live in the areas impacted by these hurricanes.

She wasn't alone in this.   It was culture at FEMA.    If you look at the initial reporting on this by the Daily Wire it includes several ""field reports"" by her subordinates where they put, *in writing on a public form*, ""skipped because of Trump sign"" or some variation of that.    They clearly felt nothing would happen when they wrote that on the forms which is telling.

Interestingly, she says this happened in the Carolinas as well which most of us already knew.

We civilians did our part. We got Trump elected. Now, it’s on us to keep our government accountable 24/7.

If you react with hostility to fellow Trump supporters who raise questions or challenge the Trump administration, then you’re no better than the left. Our guy won, and it’s on us to be honest, to call balls and strikes for Trump’s legacy and our own integrity.

Also, let’s remember that being Trump supporters doesn’t make us the same. Some of you believe our government framework should adapt for security needs. Some of us don’t.

If you’re willing to compromise on our founding principles for the sake of security, then we’re not on the same page. I believe my security is my responsibility. In my view, our own government has always been the greatest threat to personal security. The founders carefully limited any one person or branch from having too much power for that very reason.

The Patriot Act, for example, is a problem because our government traded liberty for “national security.” Permanent, taxpayer-funded international alliances are another case of sacrificing freedom, only  for “international security.”

In summary, I voted for Trump because I know he is our best shot at preserving the Constitution. And I will not be quiet when he does something wrong. I want his legacy to be great. He doesn’t need yes men and women. I don’t want him to fail. But more importantly, I want my fellow citizens to see the difference between Tyranny and lawful governance so we know the difference going forward.","Tue Nov 12 19:02:23 +0000 2024"

FEMA announced the firing of a former official who directed her team to avoid disaster-zone homes with Trump signs Saturday, shining a light on how supposedly apolitical government organizations have become weaponized against Republicans.

The official, 39-year-old Marn’i Washington, instructed employees to “Implement best practices” including “Avoid[ing] homes advertising Trump.”

""This is a clear violation of FEMA's core values & principles to help people regardless of their political affiliation,"" agency administrator Deanne Criswell wrote on X. “This type of behavior and action will not be tolerated at FEMA and we will hold people accountable if they violate these standards of conduct.""

Florida’s division of emergency management is launching an investigation into the issue.

It has been rumoured that Marco Rubio is being tipped for Secretary of State by President-Elect Donald Trump. While he may not be the first Latino in a cabinet position, he will be first to head one of the powerful cabinet positions, the other being Defence, that ensures US continued hegemony in the world.

Why Marco Rubio is a good choice for America.

1. Strong Understanding of China and India:
Mr. Rubio @marcorubio comes from an average American family that has lived the American Dream. For the Chinese and the Indians, one of the biggest issues with American diplomats is their inability to understand the personalities and upbringing of Chinese and Indian leaders and how these shape their worldview and ideology. US State Department Secretaries and senior staff tend to be part of an elite (went to the right schools, belong to the right clubs, pedigree and such other privileges of the gentry) that then look down on the humble beginnings of Chinese and Indian leaders, leading to often lead unnecessary clashes of ideology and personalities. With Rubio, China and India will have a United States Secretary that will insist on US interests but also have the background in seeking shared interests as a result of similar personalities and upbringing. 

2. Strategic Focus on Latin America: 
It has become obvious to Trump @realDonaldTrump that Europe has ""bent the knee"" to Chinese money. Countries like France and Germany are using ""trade with China"" (with implications for the USD as the global currency) in an attempt to force America to continue paying for Europe's Defence. Trump is not having this, and as such, going back to America's partners in the South American continent where China, having spent billions in infrastructure development, still cannot lay claim to as the dominant force in the continent. 
With Rubio, Latin American partners will not only have a Secretary that speaks the language and understands the nuances, but also an American partner that will finally listen in helping them fight the cartels and bring real development to the people of South America. 

3. Respecting Global Cultural Values:
 From Obama to Biden, America pursued a Liberal global order that was not welcomed in conservative Africa, Middle East, Asia, and many parts of Europe. These liberal ideas by the US (remember the backlash of African leaders over the imposition of LGBTQ rights or No Aid) threatened global order such that within countries, it became a battle of light vs darkness. Rubio, a God-Fearing Catholic, understands the need of not alienating the conservative Christian, Muslim, Hindu, or personal values of billions of individuals that reside in all countries of the world. Global peace can be achieved when people and nations are treated with respect and without an imposition of alien liberal norms.

4. Practical Solutions for Migration Issues: 
Our word today is dominated by information flow from a biased global media that seeks to control how people think or act. With Trump's deportation plan, especially as many of the deportees would be from the South American continent, it makes sense to have a Secretary of State that can reach out to partners in the continent to work effective solutions to the issues leading to mass migration(something Harris failed to do), as well as resettlement efforts for deportees. This way, no matter how the biased media aim to spin it, US partners in South America will know that despite the noise, they can reach out to one of their own for clarifications, insight and explanations.

In conclusion, I say well-done Mr President-Elect Trump for putting forth Rubio as Secretary of State. Now, international relations can be international relations without wokeism.

Brussels plans to redirect up to €392 billion from the EU budget to bolster defense and security, responding to Russia’s actions in Ukraine and Trump's return to the White House.

The policy shift allows cohesion funds to support defense industries, including dual-use products and military mobility, though direct weapon purchases remain restricted.

This move is expected to aid states like Poland and Germany in enhancing infrastructure for military needs, while balancing investments in green and digital projects.

📢📢 Sound off on FEMA Creeps!

We're not just dealing with incompetence; we've got a government full of Creeps and Scumbags! Here's the latest outrage:

🌪️ FEMA FAILED TRUMP SUPPORTERS DURING HURRICANE MILTON 🌪️

Why should political affiliation dictate who gets help in a disaster? It's a blatant misuse of power and an insult to every citizen in need. Disaster relief isn't a political game; it's about humanity!
This isn't isolated. 

Here are 5 more reasons our government is overrun by the morally bankrupt:

✅Trump Persecution - The relentless legal battles against a former president, using taxpayer dollars to settle political scores, shows just how far they'll go to silence opposition.
✅""Convid"" - Remember the mask flip-flops, the suppression of alternative treatments, and the lack of transparency with Fauci and Birx? It's not about health; it's about control and lining pockets with Big Pharma cash.
✅Transing Our Kids - Pushing gender ideology in schools, often without parental consent, is not just an overreach; it's an assault on childhood innocence and biological reality, potentially robbing kids of their future reproductive rights.
✅Surveillance Overreach - Our privacy is a memory. Government agencies spy on citizens, journalists, and even political rivals. This isn't security; it's authoritarianism.
✅Cronyism and Corruption - Contracts awarded without bids, positions filled by loyalty over merit, and a revolving door between government and big business. It's not governance; it's a club for the corrupt.

We demand better. We deserve a government that serves ALL its people, not just the ones who play their political games. Time for a massive overhaul or a complete reboot! #FEMA #Trump","Tue Nov 12 17:11:37 +0000 2024"

While US President-elect Donald Trump has already announced that two sworn neocons, Mike Pompeo and Nikki Haley, won’t have a place in his future administration, it does not necessarily mean that his cabinet will be completely devoid of the them.

One just needs to take a look at Trump’s transition team.

The State Department transition team, for example, is led by Brian Hook, a neocon and former special envoy to Iran who is known for his hawkish stance on the Islamic Republic. In 2020, Hook branded Iran as the “world’s leading sponsor of terrorism” who, according to him, is not “entitled to a claim of self-defense.” He made these remarks in the wake of attacks against US military assets in Iraq sparked by the US assassination of Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps General Qassem Soleimani.

The Department of Defense transition team is not faring any better as it is headed by Robert Wilkie, ex-Veteran Affairs secretary in the first Trump admin and no dove himself. Back in September, Wilkie criticized Joe Biden for allegedly not trying hard enough to convince Europe to contribute more to fanning the Ukrainian conflict.

Wilkie also claimed that Russia’s warnings over the escalation of the Ukrainian conflict should be disregarded since the Russian Army has allegedly been “decimated,” even though US General Christopher Cavoli, NATO’s top commander in Europe, warned last month that Moscow still has ""dangerous combat forces"" and huge military potential – “both conventional and nuclear.”

The National Security Council transition team is expected to be led by Joel Rayburn (if Politico is to be believed), a man who during Trump’s first presidency sought to use Syrian Islamist groups to “counter Iran,” as the National Interest put it back in 2019.

Though it remains to be seen exactly how Trump is going to steer the United States foreign policy over the next four years, these appointments suggest that fears of a neocon renaissance under his new administration may not be unfounded.","Tue Nov 12 10:24:41 +0000 2024"

@fema is in BIG trouble!

A federal disaster relief official ordered workers to bypass the homes of Donald Trump’s supporters as they surveyed damage caused by Hurricane Milton in Florida, according to internal correspondence obtained by The Daily Wire and confirmed by multiple federal employees. 
A FEMA supervisor told workers in a message to “avoid homes advertising Trump” as they canvassed Lake Placid, Florida to identify residents who could qualify for federal aid, internal messages viewed by The Daily Wire reveal. The supervisor, Marn’i Washington, relayed this message both verbally and in a group chat used by the relief team, multiple government employees told The Daily Wire. 

The government employees told The Daily Wire that at least 20 homes with Trump signs or flags were skipped from the end of October and into November due to the guidance, meaning they were not given the opportunity to qualify for FEMA assistance. Images shared with The Daily Wire show that houses were skipped over by the workers, who wrote in the government system messages such as: “Trump sign no entry per leadership.”
It is unclear whether the same guidance was issued elsewhere in the country. The employees were part of a Department of Homeland Security surge capacity force team, meaning they volunteered from other DHS agencies to help an understaffed FEMA as it dealt with a second major hurricane in a span of just a few weeks. “I know they’re short-staffed, I thought we could go help and make a difference,” one of the employees said. “When we got there we were told to discriminate against people. It’s almost unbelievable to think that somebody in the federal government would think that’s okay.” 
The employee said it felt wrong to discriminate against Trump supporters when they were at their “most vulnerable.” 
“I volunteered to help disaster victims, not discriminate against them,” the employee said. “It didn’t matter if people were black, white, Hispanic, for Trump, for Harris. Everyone deserves the same amount of help.”The guidance came as the Biden administration was criticized over its sluggish response to Hurricane Helene in rural areas across the country. In Roan Mountain, Tennessee, for example, locals told The Daily Wire it took nearly two weeks for FEMA to show up. The town is located in Carter County, which voted 81% for Trump on Tuesday. 
The FEMA agents ordered not to help houses with Trump signs were operating in Highlands County, a deep-red area located in south central Florida that backed Trump by 70% on Tuesday. It was hit with tornadoes, torrential wind and rain, and flooding when Milton hit in October. 
In the chat, Washington said that it would be “best practice” to “avoid homes advertising Trump,” according to photos of the messages viewed by The Daily Wire. No explanation was given for this guidance, which included other recommendations like telling the workers to “practice de-escalation and preventative measures,” and to “avoid high salt diets and coffee.”Photos from the system used by federal relief workers to track what homes they visit showed that relief workers followed Washington’s guidance. Several addresses were marked “not able to access property” with listed explanations such as: “Trump sign no entry per leadership,” “Per leadership no stop Trump flag,” “Trump sign,” and “Trump sign, no contact per leadership.”
“If they had damage or lost power for over thirty-six hours, it was my duty to inform them of benefits to which they are entitled through FEMA,” one team member wrote in a complaint filed to DHS about the guidance. 
Washington is the Disaster Survivor Assistance crew leader for Highland County, a leadership chart reviewed by The Daily Wire shows. She did not respond to multiple phone calls or an email seeking comment on the guidance. 
Chad Hershey, Washington’s FEMA supervisor, told The Daily Wire that the agency is looking into the situation.
Hershey said: “We are aware of it.”","Tue Nov 12 16:45:24 +0000 2024"

However, if Trump is serving up policies & people which go the opposite way of the things he vocalized in order to gain mass support for MAGA - then I will criticize that, and harshly so in the arena of foreign policy which is my primary area of expertises. As I said in interviews before the election, Trump will likely do a better job domestically, because the mission is clear & he knows how to execute it, but that’s not the case internationally - Republicans are traditionally poor on geopolitical knowledge, history & tend to shoot from the hip with a evangelical worldview couched in outdated imperialist grandeur. Judging by the low-quality individuals he has selected thus far to front foreign policy,  it more or less proves my thesis.

Without fear, nor favor. That’s what I taught, often to my detriment. That said, I still wish all MSM journos & foreign policy wonks could apply the same principles, instead of defaulting to sycophanty and political opportunism.","Tue Nov 12 10:54:15 +0000 2024"
