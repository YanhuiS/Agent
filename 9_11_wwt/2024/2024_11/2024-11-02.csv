This Editorial is my opinion, I alone am responsible for the content. This is my final editorial before the 2024 Presidential Election.

Let’s talk about Donald Trump, the man (monster) that he is. His heyday was the 1980s when he rose to “stardom,” if you want to call it that. I remember the news about the young billionaire in New York, he was always a hot topic. He was a narcissist then and that certainly has not changed. He called himself a Democrat back in those days. 

Let me do some comparisons to his look and talk that he does today in his hate rallies and I think you will understand what I have been thinking, HE IS STUCK IN THE 80s! He was thought then to be a great and successful businessman but if you were around back then as I was, you will recall that many of his businesses were failures. Who bankrupts a casino? Native Americans and other businessmen have been quite successful with casinos but he couldn’t be. Trump University, Trump steaks etc. all failures. How the man got a Star on the sidewalk Hollywood Walk of Fame is a mystery to me, he’s always been a jerk. He has always thought of himself as a chick magnet, but in actuality, he was a sexual predator and a rapist. He fit in well with the Epstein group. I believe Epstein was murdered to make sure he didn’t spill the beans. How did Trump get three wives? Simple, money, some women will fall for that. The only one who may have talked was Ivana and she is now buried on the grounds of his Bedminister Golf Club. Fishy, was she eliminated, her fall down the stairs sounds very Putin-like to me. Just my opinion. The other two wives, are a mystery. Why is Melania hanging around? Money? She sure doesn’t seem to enjoy being around him. 

Think about his current appearance, the clothes from the 80s, baggy suits and long ties, still wearing them today. The rally music, mostly 80’s, YMCA (these were gay guys except for the lead, Victor Willis) I wonder why he likes that song since he is so anti LGBTQIA. This is a Man’s World and I am sure you can think of more, they are mostly 80s songs. His fascination with Hannibal Lecter, the cannibal in Silence of the Lambs, I liken his fascination to Hannibal with “they are eating the cats, they are eating the dogs.” All can be tied to his hate of immigrants and  his statements that they are sent from mental institutions. Getting the picture? He loved  doing The Apprentice and firing people, he still does! I never watched the show, by the time it came out, I was so over hearing about The Donald and saw through his lying, playboy, cheating personality. Again, I say, Trump is stuck in the 80s, forty some years ago when he was a young man and in his “prime.”Trump is still living in those years. He has become worse, more dangerous and now seems to be in severe mental and physical decline. Even his niece Mary Trump has warned us about Donald, believe her. He should be silenced.

The question in my mind remains, why has the MAGA party, formally the Republican Party, latched onto this treacherous, lying man? Surely there would have been better choices in 2016, 2020 and 2024. As for 2020, he legitimately lost and has continued his lies about that. He knows he lost. If he were such a smart businessman wouldn’t you think he would know that once a company fires you, that’s it. No need to re-apply, but here we are. Any sane American knows that if he were to win the election we would be looking at the loss of our democracy. Trump is old, mentally and physically inept and not  fit to be President of the United States, not to mention a felon. In my opinion, if he were to win, he would be quickly cast aside and Vance would be president. Either way, both are willing to destroy our government and replace it with the horrors of Project 2025. It would be a disaster for women, children, seniors, middle class, immigrants and anyone who is considered vermin and the enemy from within. Sounds terrible.

Lombardo was the two-time elected Sheriff of Clark County -- Las Vegas -- before he ran for Gov.  

The fact that Lombardo had a re-election machine in Clark County, winning twice in Nevada's biggest county before winning statewide in 2022, might be a significant contributing factor to the GOP's improved performance this cycle.  

Maybe we have the Joe Lombardo machine kicking the Harry Reid machine to the curb.  

THAT is something Ralston has not mentioned anywhere in his reporting this year.

In the ancient times of a few years ago, during Trump's actual presidency, Liz Cheney was a staunch backer of his foreign policy. What is it precisely that Cheney and Trump now are said to vehemently disagree on? They remain in firm agreement on issues such as Iran and Israel. Trump has now *adopted* her position on Afghanistan. Even on Russia, Liz cheered for Trump foreign policy actions like abrogating the INF Treaty, arming Ukraine, and expanding NATO. So, ""where's the beef""?

Could it be that there *is* no policy content to the dispute, other than the fact that Liz decided Jan 6 was the most monumental day in human history, voted to impeach Trump, and consequently got ejected from the Republican Party? If she were ejected for her foreign policy views, why is it that countless Republicans with identical foreign policy views (Tom Cotton, Marco Rubio, Lindsey Graham, Elise Stefanik, Mike Waltz, to name a few) are among the most enthusiastic Trump campaign surrogates?

Top GOP lawmakers are pressing the White House to amend an official transcript after President Biden allegedly called Trump supporters “garbage” in a call with Voto Latino.

Reps. Stefanik and Comer argue altering transcripts undermines transparency, calling it a “breach of protocol.”

They have always been this way, and so when loyalists who believe he’s going to win get close, these same staffers go out of their way to spread lies and attack the loyalists. 

This is why I say unity is a farce.

Most of his campaign staff hate each other. It’s nonstop back stabbing and maneuvering to try to undermine anyone who is praised by President Trump. Of course, people work together to get a job done, but just because people work together doesn’t mean they like each other. 

Attacks on loyalists to the media by members of President Trump’s own staff is deliberately done as a way to 1. Undermine President Trump, and 2. demoralize President Trump’s biggest supporters and the loyalists who have always supported him. 

To feel better about themselves, some of the staff who are only there for a paycheck plant hit pieces against his biggest supporters to try to destroy anyone who they don’t want working in the Trump administration.

These are the same people who like taking credit for other people’s work and blaming others when issues arise. 

Pay no mind to the hit pieces. 

Just keep working hard and fight for President Trump as hard as you can. 

The loyalists will always fight for Trump. 

Most staff on any campaign would leave tomorrow if the money dried up. 

This is why you can’t take what they say in hit pieces seriously. 

When Trump wins, it will be because of the loyalists. Not the leakers and opportunists who just want a paycheck. 

People will always try to demoralize and attack those who are over the target. 

That’s all this comes down to.","Sat Nov 02 20:28:59 +0000 2024"

Swear to God. 

I have always believed Donald Trump is going to win. And for the record, I know he is going to win, And that’s why I work hard everyday to support him. 

I don’t know why some people went to work for Donald Trump if they don’t like Donald Trump. 

Sadly, not all of his staff believe in him and so some of them behave like children and gossip to the media because I suppose it’s easier to gossip than it is to actually work or be good at your job (and we all know how much harder I work and how much more savvy I am than some of the people who work for President Trump). 

The stories I broke this election season should have been uncovered by people on his own team. But they weren’t…

Let’s not forget who exposed Judge Merchan. 

Hint: it wasn’t anyone who worked for Trump. 

Instead of working harder in the last 3 days of the campaign, some of his staff are planting nasty stories about TRUMP LOYALISTS in the media because they want to deflect from their own inadequacies and disloyalty to President Trump. 

Perhaps a better use of time in the last 3 days of the campaign is working hard to bring home a victory instead of behaving like children and gossiping to enemy media.

Donald Trump deserves better than people on his own campaign team leaking lies to the media about his campaign and campaign supporters. Donald Trump deserves loyalty and support. He has worked hard and sacrificed so much for all of us, and now we need to get everyone out to vote and condemn those who are planting lies in the media. 

I suppose this is a glimpse into what we can expect in the second admin if snakes aren’t weeded out.","Sat Nov 02 20:04:48 +0000 2024"

How do we select good people? People who are reliable ideologically *and* characterologically? People who are smart, aligned, competent, and won't embarrass the organizations that affiliate with them?

These selection filters gets very narrow, very fast, and if we are being honest, it becomes clear that finding *good* people at scale is actually quite difficult.

Firstly, ideological alignment is necessary but insufficient. People can whinge about it all they want but optics matter. You have to know how to not raise people's alarm bells. In the context of administrative/public life you have to practice a certain amount of rhetorical and operational prudence. This cuts against the personality type of many early adopters of now au courant rw views. These types tend to be (almost pathologically) disagreeable. Those who cannot code-switch and suppress that tendency when necessary are going to cause problems and often be more trouble than they are worth.

Secondly, those who can code-switch, who can succeed in an administrative setting, and who also are aligned (i.e. have successfully resisted leftism), tend to already be professionally successful, or are well down the path to professional success, and have *a lot* to lose by openly aligning with the right and/or leaving behind their (probably very well paying) jobs for the pittance they will earn as political operatives. The perception (if not fact) that the right does not take care of its own people, makes this an incredibly difficult sell. Leaving a successful law practice, or job in finance, or in tech etc. just doesn't add up for all but a very few.

For those in this latter group, the onus is on the right to protect these people, ensure a meaningful (if not exorbitant) livelihood, and the promise that good service will be rewarded with opportunities and yes, money, once their political work is done. As Silicon Valley, eg, begins to flirt with the right, it has to be the case that those who want the right to prevail, the JD Vance wing of the right to prevail, that the appropriate incentives are in place to recruit capable and aligned people into public service who are incurring massive opportunity costs by doing so. Will a crypto rw tech bro who goes to work for Trump have a place in Silicon Valley when his term ends? There has to be a very loud signal that the answer is yes.

For the former, the onus is on the ideologically aligned poster to demonstrate that he won't embarrass people who affiliate with him. Some people should just stay posters. It is a noble and worthy role. And in fact anyone who is a poster and has ambitions beyond that, I immediately regard with suspicion. Their aspirations often overtake their political commitments and their personal loyalties. They are more likely to defect and betray the interests they previously supported. Rather than concentrating on getting stuff done, the main concern is engaging in the petty ego-driven carnival of ""political influencer."" You don't have to compromise your beliefs and shouldn't, but it's perfectly legitimate that the vetting of these types is much more stringent.

I don't have answers to this double problem––those who can, don't need to or want to, and those who want to carry a lot of different risks. This is only to say that the selection of personnel––particularly young people on the right––as we go through this major generational and ideological transition, is of critical importance. Personnel selection is maybe *the most* important thing for us to be thinking about. And the people in charge of personnel selection need to be taking this very seriously.","Sat Nov 02 19:29:36 +0000 2024"

It’s like the more he talks out of both sides of his mouth, the more brazen he is, and the more lies he shares, the more his supporters double down with him.

Somehow, he has convinced a segment of the American population, including many evangelical Christians, that he is actually for their best interest - even after inciting an insurrection, fawning over dictators, flip flopping on a host of issues, incessantly lying, cheating on his spouse, saying all sorts of racist things, joking about sexually assaulting women, bribing people, etc.

Also, he is a convicted felon. Think about that. Regardless of what your views are on how he got to trial, he was put to a high profile trial of his own peers - and found guilty.

He’s also constantly trying to sell people memorabilia about himself - whether it’s shoes or statues (mini idols?) or Bibles. How are Christians ok with someone working to profit off of Scripture like this? 

Which other convicted felon with so much evidence of moral bankruptcy could get a people who believe that character matters to vote for them?

We wouldn’t want someone like him to teach our children in the classroom or handle our money at the bank, but there are people who want him to run the country. Trump is the greatest conman in the world.

What does this say about him? What does it say about the state of our country?

If you are a Christian like me and see this as strange, know that you are not alone.","Sat Nov 02 13:05:20 +0000 2024"

Here is my answer

I have already accepted we will have a dysfunctional federal government and planned my life accordingly. 

If he does win I will behave just like I did from 16-20

Applaud him when he does something good for the American people and follows through on his promises. Call congress and senate and urge them to support bills that he leads the way on that I agree with as a conservative 

Hold him to account and speak out strongly when he goes off the reservation and pushes leftist policies and hires incompetent sycophants.

I don’t think he will follow through on most of his “good” promises but I would love to be proven wrong. My ego of being right about him is irrelevant compared to my fellow Americans having a better life as a result of Trump policies.

I won’t change my beliefs to support or oppose him and my default position on all politicians and especially him is to be very skeptical and cautious and judge them on actual actions and results….not words.","Sat Nov 02 18:37:48 +0000 2024"

In His Own Words…

On the day Trump was shot, Elon posted:

 “I fully endorse President Trump and hope for his rapid recovery.”

Since then, Elon, against all business sense, has been one of the most vocal supporters of Trump. 

Why? Here are a few of Elon’s reasons… 

“America needs a strong hand, someone who can take a punch and keep going. Trump has that.”

“Regulation in this country is out of control. Trump gets that better than anyone.”

“The border and election integrity seem to be the two things he cares about.”

“Free speech in under attack… Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square.”

“We are in a perilous moment for democracy… I think the choice is obvious.”

“The fate of our civilization is at stake.”
