@realDonaldTrump  administration is rumored to propose eliminating capital gains taxes on U.S.-issued cryptocurrencies. 

This groundbreaking policy could transform the U.S. into a tax-free crypto haven, attracting investors to projects tied closely to American innovation.

Its cutting-edge infrastructure powers IRON SPIDR, a secure and scalable network set to be  integrated into Platform One, the DoD’s premier DevSecOps environment.

Building on this foundation, Constellation is driving national innovation through @UTSADigiFoundry , uniting top-tier working groups focused on blockchain’s role in AI, machine learning, and critical data security. 

These collaborations cement Constellation’s leadership in building secure, quantum-resistant solutions for the federal government and enterprise adoption.

Dear @danroberts0101 

Now is the right time for you to ROAR like @saylor and go ALL IN. Don't hold yourself. Take the road less traveled, like you did with NO HODL strategy.

Firstly, Trump's win has ensured that US will have its first PRO Bitcoin govt, hence now it is the BEST time for @IREN_Ltd to change its HQ to the US, please don't shrug this off.

Secondly, ATM offerings need a FULL STOP now. Raise Billions $ not just Millions but with Convertibles and raise your EH target or grow your CSP business exponentially.

Lastly, hyperscaler AI Deal should be the top most priority of $IREN. Brief us ANYTHING you can about it on 26th. It's now or never.

Cheers!","Tue Nov 19 22:21:25 +0000 2024"

The stakes have never been higher. The global elite - who know their days are numbered following Trump’s election win - are pushing us toward World War 3, all to protect their money laundering operation in Ukraine and advance their dystopian agendas.

Now, with Biden's approval for Ukraine to use U.S. long-range weapons inside Russia, the globalists have crossed a red line: an unconstitutional act of war that risks igniting the nuclear catastrophe we’ve long feared.

You want the reality of it? In just 72 minutes of nuclear exchange, 60% of the world’s population - five billion people - will either be vaporized instantly or suffer an excruciating death from radiation. The survivors wouldn’t fare much better, living in a modern hellscape, as nuclear winter plunges us into chaos. Society as we know it would collapse.","Tue Nov 19 21:52:00 +0000 2024"

The Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD), founded in 2017, became a central player in efforts to tie President Donald Trump and his supporters to Russian interference in the 2016 election. Among its co-founders were Mike Rogers, former Republican congressman and chair of the House Intelligence Committee; Michael McFaul, Obama’s former ambassador to Russia; Michael Chertoff, former Secretary of Homeland Security under George W. Bush; and Michael Hayden, former CIA and NSA director. These figures, with deep ties to the intelligence community and bipartisan opposition to Trump, were instrumental in advancing ASD’s agenda and its controversial Hamilton 68 project. 

Hamilton 68, presented as a tool to track Russian disinformation on social media, targeted over 600 Twitter accounts. However, many of these accounts were not linked to Russia but were instead ordinary Americans, journalists, and Trump supporters expressing dissenting political views. Despite this, Hamilton 68’s data was widely cited to support claims of ongoing widespread Russian interference and to insinuate that various policies, events or movements were backed by secret Russian operations. The project reinforced a narrative that Trump’s presidency was compromised, even as Hamilton 68’s methodology and conclusions were later exposed as deeply flawed and misleading. 

ASD was funded by entities like the German Marshall Fund and the National Endowment for Democracy, both of which are closely tied to the intelligence community and have long promoted foreign policy agendas at odds with Trump’s claimed policy of reducing U.S. intervention abroad. 

Hamilton 68 was eventually discredited when it was revealed that its methodology falsely labeled Americans as participants in Russian influence campaigns. The platform’s true purpose appeared to be casting suspicion on Trump’s supporters and reinforcing claims that his presidency was illegitimate and that only a well funded deep state could save the nation. Despite its collapse, many media corporations made only discrete corrections (if at all) to the false stories they had based on Hamilton 68 data.","Tue Nov 19 22:58:30 +0000 2024"

Rep. Comer disclosed that a new FEMA whistleblower claims a contractor urged an elderly veteran’s family in Georgia to remove Trump signs, citing FEMA supervisors’  view of Trump supporters as “domestic terrorists.” 

The family, fearing retaliation and loss recovery, complied, yet FEMA has not returned. 

Rep Comer:

 “My staff just made contact with a new whistleblower who provided a credible account that a FEMA contractor visited the home of an elderly disabled veteran’s family around October 10.

While there, he recommended that the family remove Trump campaign materials and signs from their house and yard, stating that his FEMA supervisors view Trump supporters as domestic terrorists.”

@LauraLoomer doesn't get enough credit for this...

She was responsible for pushing this sentencing back which gave Trump the critical time he needed to win the election. 

How did she do this? 

DAYS before Trump's sentencing she exposed Judge Merchans daughter as working for and receiving money from Kamala Harris, Trumps opposition...a gross conflict of interest. 

This exposure forced Merchan to push the sentencing back and allowed Trump to win. 

Now, the judge who was once salivating to  sentence Trump quietly adjourned the case...

And isn’t it disturbing that these “astrologers” who claim to be connected to the divine universe, hate and oppose a man (Trump) who clearly wishes to bring peace to this world. Why are so many astrologers repping for money laundering war pigs?

The Tony Michaels Podcast

Tensions boil over as Elon Musk and Donald Trump’s alliance frays. From cabinet clashes to policy disagreements, this is a showdown of egos with America’s direction hanging in the balance.

This tension is a stark reminder of unchecked egos in positions of power. Musk’s push for tech-centric cabinet picks likely clashes with Trump’s populist rhetoric and old-school nationalist advisors.

Musk’s alignment with global markets (notably China) contradicts Trump’s America-first trade policies. It’s another example of billionaires wielding outsized influence while their priorities differ from public needs.

The battle for the media spotlight showcases the problematic cult of personality politics on both sides.

And if you go back a year ago, President Trump actually at rallies to loud applause has been talking very similar points to RFK. So we got to know RFK. Sitting watching the first assassination attempt, I had like a spiritual, what I can call it, kind of out of body experience."" 

""And I felt the need to call Robert. I think what he has done, is historic. The fact that he was getting up to 20% of the vote, highlighting this issue, tapping in, I think, to this consciousness and tapping into this stream that you're tapping into, I think it really showed something. And I had this vision for a year, actually. It sounds very woo-woo, but I was in a sweat tent with him in Austin at a campaign event six months before."" 

""And I just had this strong vision of him standing with Trump and how what RFK represents is actually what Trump represents and actually what almost every American's feeling, which is this frustration and this rigged thing and this thing that doesn't quite feel right that you can't quite put your finger on. And it was so clear to me that how RFK talks about health personifies this overall kind of institutional capture."" 

""It makes it real for people in a really visceral way because it's clearly impacting their kids. So that was all the context. Pick up the phone, called him and just urged him. you know, as a supporter, as a lowly supporter, to consider maybe this is the time as President Trump put his fist up, you know, with all this momentum. There's rare moments in history where the deck can change."" 

""And I really felt and he felt like this could be a realignment of American politics because that moment felt very heavy after the assassination. So we went back and forth and he asked to, you know, he's like, let me talk to him. So I worked with Tucker and we connected them that night. And here's the key point I want to make from my small vantage point here. They had weeks of conversations, and there was not a discussion of polling."" 

""There was not a discussion of the horse race and how this would impact the race. These were cure field conversations about why kids are getting so diabetic, about why we have such obese children in the United States, about why we have a fertility crisis. This was a true connection of these two men and a true deep bond, which I think you're seeing out there on the campaign trail that this transcends politics and this wants to Trump wants this to be a generational issue for him."" 

""And I just want to say something. I think we're at a big moment here. There's, we're debating trivia. Like I think the two most existential issues are nuclear war or what's happening to our health and whatever you think. And I used to be a never Trump or watching him care about this issue, watching what's happening with the RFK, watching what's happening of how that's resonating with voters, seeing from my small vantage point inside, there is tremendous connection of these two men and moral clarity of seeing what's happening."" 

""And my question is this, and to anyone kind of considering voting in this election, Trump is gonna say stupid shit. He is Trump, we know who he is. There's two important questions to ask. Who sees this corruption and institutional capture that's going to destroy our country, I think, to an existential level? and who is willing to suffer that blowback? Who is willing to go up against these military industrial complex, the healthcare industrial complex, the education industrial complex that's making us a non-competitive?"" 

""Like, they are ready. Who is going to a point, this is a question I have, who do we believe is going to appoint people like RFK, people like Elon Musk, to stir stuff up? Who is gonna do that? Like, that to me is the foundational question, and I... do consider this the most important election of my lifetime, watching these two men, because it is so genuine. And there is like a genuine desire to truly transform, to see our broken corruption and institutions for what it is, and really, truly, I think, prevent nuclear war and dramatically reverse our health crisis."" 

""Trump has said that his one big mistake last time was personnel. was that the pharma and the ag slithered in and gave him the list of names. Everybody should ask, do you think RFK is going to have an influence on those names based on what Trump has said? And I think he is. And I think people like Elon are going to be involved. I think there's this coalition of people that are coming together and Trump's going to put in power and listen to. And this is a bipartisan issue."" 

""And no matter what happens, we have to solve this issue. But I will say this so clearly with the most conviction I can, we will... be on the verge, I think, of a health population collapse, societally destabilizing event, unless true executive leadership sees this corruption and this issue for what it is, and says we need a radical transformation in how we see agriculture and how we see health, our two largest industries."" 

""I think we have to have that. And every single member of Congress I meet with, including Democrats, say that in order for this issue to get done, we need a president to make this the priority to talk, because that gives us air cover, and there could be transformational change. if a president does that. So that's what I've seen from being in this. And I can tell you, President Trump has kept every promise to RFK and deeply cares about this issue.""","Tue Nov 19 12:36:34 +0000 2024"

From a tiny office behind a Haitian grocery store on Springfield’s South Limestone Street, Margery Koveleski has spent years destroying Ohio by helping Haitians overcome red tape to make their lives in the Ohio city a little bit easier.

But Koveleski – whose family is Haitian – has noticed a major change recently.

Haitians are now coming to her to figure out how to leave.

“Some folks don’t have credit cards or access to the internet, and they want to buy a bus ticket or a plane ticket, so we help them book a flight,” she told the Guardian recently. “People are leaving.”

Actual ""refugees"" don't leave. Economic scammers and criminals leave.

People complain when folks say each election is the most important ever. However, this election was one of the most important elections in American history.

If Trump didn't win then America would have become a single-party state and turned into Canada. 

Let me explain

The Democrats would have packed the Supreme Court. Can you imagine who she would have replaced Alito and Thomas with?

Your free speech rights would have been over. They would have said it was hate speech and disinformation. Undermining Democracy line would have been used for everything. 

The Democrats would have pushed for mass amnesty and that would have encouraged more caravans to cross the border. Ensuring thousands of new voters.

She supported ending the filibuster to restore Roe vs Wade. So all of the Pro-Life people who complained about Trump would have lost everything if Abortion became the Law of the Land. 

Democrats would have pushed statehood for DC and Puerto Rico to become the 51st and 52nd states. This would have granted Democrats 4 solid blue Senators, 2 solid blue representatives, and 6 electoral college votes.

There would have been some sort of event that was very tragic. Think of Sanyhook 2.0. As a result, voluntary buyback programs would have been installed. 

Parents would have lost the available to make choices in their children's educational curriculum. 

The attacks against would have gotten Christianity much worse.

There would have been a push to move towards the Popular Vote instead of the Electoral College because that would have been much easier to win.

Can you imagine a lockdown under her administration? Forced vaccines mandates

On the world stage, the US would have spent billions more on Ukraine. The wokeness of our military would continue. The DEI hires in the military would have only gotten worse. The wokeness and DEI would have gotten worse nationwide.

The economy would have collapsed. She wanted to raise the corporate tax rate to 28% She supported corporate price-gouging on groceries and imposed stiff penalties on the food industry. In other words food shortages. Companies would have sent their jobs overseas and to Mexico. The National Debt will get much worse.

Will Trump single-handedly save America? No probably not but no man can single-handedly save the country.

What Trump did was to keep the Wolves away for another 4 years.

The 2028 election matters but even if Democrats win they will spend 4 years working to undo the Trump agenda. That means 2032 or 2036 would be a very critical election but I think Vance will win in 2028.

Some elections don't matter like the 2004 Two Skull and Bones members running.

However, the 2016 and the 2024 elections were very important to the country's survival.

God intervened both times and Trump won.

Remember this when you complain about Trump in the future.

The wolves are at bay for another 4 years and hopefully longer.","Tue Nov 19 02:04:12 +0000 2024"

FEMA Administrator Deanna Criswell was pressed in a House subcommittee hearing on Tuesday to reports that hurricane relief workers had passed over the homes of Trump supporters.

House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Chair Scott Perry (R-PA) grilled Criswell on whether the FEMA supervisor's unethical directive was reflective of a broader agency ""culture.""

""We have an ongoing investigation, chairman Perry, to determine if there was any additional acts that violated our core values of compassion, fairness, integrity, and respect,"" Criswell said.

""Okay, so I get there's an ongoing investigation, but this isn't a law enforcement thing where you can't say, well, we have an investigation, so we can't talk about it.,"" Perry said. ""You can talk about this. Does the investigation include her immediate supervisors and several steps above that?""

""The investigation includes those that were deployed in this particular incident, and we have found no evidence that there is anything beyond this one employee's specific direction,"" she replied.

""At this point, you’ve found no evidence,"" Perry repeated. ""Let me ask you this: Now, you can understand that from America’s perspective, certainly the people that weren’t visited when FEMA was in town, that it would be in FEMA’s best interest to just investigate this internally, say this is a one-off employee, that this claim of hers that it’s a culture is just her trying to kind of make sure that the responsibility of the accountability doesn’t fall on her. Why shouldn’t this be an independent investigation by at least somebody like the IG?""

""The actions that this employee took are unacceptable,"" Criswell replied.

""I know that and you know that we agree on that,"" Perry fired back.

""I would welcome an investigation by the IG,"" she said.

""But you haven't requested,"" he noted. ""Will you request one?""

""I will request one,"" she conceded.

""Thank you,"" he said.

The FEMA incident is now set to launch an IG investigation into how widespread the partisan culture is at the nation's top emergency response agency.

On Saturday, FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell had called the unnamed employee’s action “reprehensible,” and added that the matter had been referred to the Office of Special Counsel.

“This is a clear violation of FEMA’s core values & principles to help people regardless of their political affiliation,” Criswell said.

We will see about that.

FEMA's internal probe will now be elevated to an independent IG investigation, thanks to pushback from Republican House leaders like Chairman @RepScottPerry.","Tue Nov 19 19:23:33 +0000 2024"

2. Foreign policy and national security experts spent years condemning populism and demonizing Trump, with some going so far as to actively subvert his agenda and break laws and bend rules to destroy him. Retribution is a real and terrifying possibility.

3. Washington has long been a permissive environment, where waste, incompetence, corruption, and conflicts of interest are allowed to flourish. Lives, careers, and fortunes now hang in the balance.

The Alliance for Securing Democracy (ASD), founded in 2017, became a central player in efforts to tie President Donald Trump and his supporters to Russian interference in the 2016 election. Among its co-founders were Mike Rogers, former Republican congressman and chair of the House Intelligence Committee; Michael McFaul, Obama’s former ambassador to Russia; Michael Chertoff, former Secretary of Homeland Security under George W. Bush; and Michael Hayden, former CIA and NSA director. These figures, with deep ties to the intelligence community and bipartisan opposition to Trump, were instrumental in advancing ASD’s agenda and its controversial Hamilton 68 project.

Hamilton 68, presented as a tool to track Russian disinformation on social media, targeted over 600 Twitter accounts. However, many of these accounts were not linked to Russia but were instead ordinary Americans, journalists, and Trump supporters expressing dissenting political views. Despite this, Hamilton 68’s data was widely cited to support claims of ongoing widespread Russian interference and to insinuate that various policies, events or movements were backed by secret Russian operations. The project reinforced a narrative that Trump’s presidency was compromised, even as Hamilton 68’s methodology and conclusions were later exposed as deeply flawed and misleading.

ASD was funded by entities like the German Marshall Fund and the National Endowment for Democracy, both of which are closely tied to the intelligence community and have long promoted foreign policy agendas at odds with Trump’s claimed policy of reducing U.S. intervention abroad.

Hamilton 68 was eventually discredited when it was revealed that its methodology falsely labeled Americans as participants in Russian influence campaigns. The platform’s true purpose appeared to be casting suspicion on Trump’s supporters and reinforcing claims that his presidency was illegitimate and that only a well funded deep state could save the nation. Despite its collapse, many media corporations made only discrete corrections (if at all) to the false stories they had based on Hamilton 68 data.","Tue Nov 19 15:11:00 +0000 2024"

Seven months after Ernesto Ramirez Jr. died from vaccine-induced myocarditis, FEMA shamelessly offered his father financial support if he changed the official cause of his son's death to COVID.

Ernest Sr. firmly responded, “I would never do that. I would definitely never disrespect my son in that way.” 

Despite his clear refusal, FEMA persisted in trying to bribe him a second time.

Once again, Ernest Sr. stood his ground, saying, “No, I won’t do that. I’m not gonna lie on a government document for blood money.”

Ernesto Ramirez Jr., described as “the best son a father could ask for,” was just 16 years old when he tragically died within five days after receiving the Pfizer shot in April 2021.

His father, Ernest Sr. (@rgvrunner01), continues to honor his memory to this day, as he now looks “for justice for Jr. and the vaxxed injured.”","Tue Nov 19 03:56:59 +0000 2024"
