We support abolishing victimless crimes, not prosecuting them.

We support ending taxation, not shifting to tariffs.

We oppose the death penalty, not using it on drug dealers.

In fact I have mentioned I’m relinquishing my vote to the people

I don’t care about Trump I don’t care about Kamala I care about our country and policy

I care about geniuses not celebrities that haven’t read even a small fraction of the books I have read

I care about Elon Musk $TSLA

I also am ALLERGIC TO STUPIDITY!!!!!!!!

Kamala Harris spent 50 billion dollars to hook up a small population of the country to the internet 

Not one person got hooked up

Starlink

The End

Stupidity must stop, don’t vote on ur fkng dumb personal feelings

If u have personal feelings shove them up ur ass they 90% most likely wrong 

Vote on math, science, and the ability to hook up the entire country to the internet would literally be the best achievement any President has ever made

Trump supporters vs Kamala supporters. 

The assignment was to go out and sell something over the weekend (candy bars, magazines, cookies etc.) and then on Monday morning, give a presentation on the sales strategy they used. 

Whoever made the most money would be declared the winners.

Trump supporters went first. “We sold hand tools: hammers, screwdrivers, crescent wrenches, sockets etc. and made $347.00 dollars.

We explained to our customers that If they invested their money in tools, they would be able to use them to work hard and make good money. They could be self-independent, support their family and be proud Americans.”

Kamala supporters went next. “We sold mouthwash and made $3,457.00 dollars.
We found the busiest corner in town and put a sign up that said ‘Free Cookies.’ All the customers said the same thing,

“This tastes like dog crap.” 
“It is dog crap,” We told them. “Want to buy some mouthwash?”

We used the standard democrat sales strategy of giving you something sh*ty for free and then making you pay to get the bad taste out of your mouth.”

This race is so close it could swing either way—Trump could win, and Harris could win. It’s a 50-50 chance right now. Turnout alone will determine the winner, nothing else.

Don’t dismiss your opponent before the battle is won. Harris could be the one to take down Trump. If there’s a massive turnout of young people and women, the odds are against Trump winning; if there’s a high turnout among men, the odds are against Harris. Some are even criticizing latecomers endorsing Trump, convinced he’s already won and that they’re just showing up to use him.

Everything unfolding now has happened throughout history, and from what I’ve read, the historical odds are against Trump. If he wins, it will be a major accomplishment—a seismic return to power. But again, Trump could win, or Harris could win; it’s tight. Don’t dismiss anyone until the game is over. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.","Mon Oct 28 19:37:54 +0000 2024"

Listen closely to the lame street press and you can still hear echoes of the nastiest hoax in U.S. history piercing into the 2024 Presidential election.

The press knows the truth; they don’t care. They want Harris to win —so Putin collusion will be the ‘Scarlet Letter’ sash Donald Trump must endure.

Reflected in the filings of John John Durham:

The truth about the Russian collusion story is that it was seeded by the Clinton campaign, the DNC and their law firm Perkins Coie, and their opposition research firm Fusion GPS.  

Not a soul who pushed the coup that defamed Donald Trump was held accountable. 
So here we are.
Clinton is free to roam.
Free to perch on news shows and pontificate …and accuse.

Here's a reality check for you, Al:

🔥 Tawana Brawley Hoax: Remember when Sharpton supported a woman who falsely accused four white men of kidnapping and raping her? She was found covered in feces in a trash bag, and despite overwhelming evidence, Sharpton stood by her, leading to lawsuits and a tarnished reputation for the falsely accused. 
🔥 Crown Heights Riot: In 1991, Sharpton's inflammatory rhetoric during the Crown Heights riot, where he marched with a sign reading ""No Justice, No Peace,"" directly contributed to days of violence, including the death of Yankel Rosenbaum, a Jewish student, amidst chants of ""Kill the Jew.""
🔥 Freddy's Fashion Mart Incident (1995): Sharpton was criticized for his involvement in protests against Freddy's Fashion Mart in Harlem. The protests, which followed the store's Jewish owners evicting a black sub-tenant for non-payment of rent, turned violent. A protestor eventually set the store on fire, leading to eight deaths. Sharpton was accused of inflaming racial tensions with his rhetoric during this event.
🔥 Duke Lacrosse Case (2006): Sharpton initially supported the accuser in the Duke University lacrosse team rape case, which later fell apart due to inconsistencies in her story and lack of physical evidence. He marched with Jesse Jackson in Durham to support her claims, which were eventually discredited.
🔥 Trayvon Martin Case (2012): Sharpton led protests and was a visible figure in the media during the aftermath of Trayvon Martin's shooting. His involvement was criticized by some for potentially escalating racial tensions and for his initial portrayal of the incident as racially motivated, which was a complex issue debated in court.

🔥 Disgusting Quotes: 
1. ""White folks was in the caves while we was building empires."" - This quote has been criticized for promoting racial division by suggesting a simplistic and historically inaccurate view of racial superiority.
2. ""If the Jews want to get it on, tell them to pin their yarmulkes back and come over to my house."" - Said during the Crown Heights riots, this quote was seen as inflammatory and contributing to racial and religious tensions.
3. On the Tawana Brawley case: ""I will not accept any guilt for Tawana Brawley. I did what any leader would do... I believed my client."" - This statement has been critiqued for his refusal to acknowledge the hoax even after it was debunked, showing a lack of accountability.
4. On the Duke Lacrosse case: Initially, he supported the accuser, saying, ""It's time to take a stand,"" without full evidence, which later turned out to be a false accusation. This involvement has been criticized for rushing to judgment based on racial lines.
5. ""ALL WHITE PEOPLE ARE BORN RACIST, AND ALL THESE COPS KILLING OUR OWN IS PROOF OF THAT.""- AL SHARPTON MSNBC

Sharpton has been criticized for racial baiting, leading protests based on false premises, and his association with controversial figures like Don King, all while claiming to fight for justice. 

It's time to see through the smoke and mirrors. If you're looking for actual leadership and results, not just divisive noise, Vote Trump. MAGA.","Mon Oct 28 16:16:00 +0000 2024"

Don’t dismiss your opponent before the battle is won. Harris could be the one to take down Trump. If there’s a massive turnout of young people and women, the odds are against Trump winning; if there’s a high turnout among men, the odds are against Harris. Some are even criticizing latecomers endorsing Trump, convinced he’s already won and that they’re just showing up to use him.

Everything unfolding now has happened throughout history, and from what I’ve read, the historical odds are against Trump. If he wins, it will be a major accomplishment—a seismic return to power. But again, Trump could win, or Harris could win; it’s tight. Don’t dismiss anyone until the game is over. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.","Mon Oct 28 19:37:54 +0000 2024"

Strategically placed MAGAs in key election positions within swing states are planning to wreak post-election havoc & chaos via frivolous challenges, etc., with the intent of making it impossible for one or more counties to certify their results. 

Several states have laws barring them from assigning their electors until ALL counties have certified, and if enough states hold back their electors and neither Trump nor Harris get to the required 270, the decision gets moved into the MAGA-controlled House of Representatives, where each state gets one vote regardless of population…and Donald Trump wins due to the fact there’s more red states than blue.  

It’s similar to what they’d ultimately hoped might happen in 2020 if Pence had illegally refused to certify, and they’ve spent the last 3+ years making sure nothing stands in their way this time around.   Trump lost by more than 8 MILLION votes in 2020 BEFORE January 6th, and has only hemorrhaged support since then.  

Everyone around Trump knows he has no chance of winning without cheating.","Mon Oct 28 04:26:07 +0000 2024"

Republicans are having their Trump lawn signs vandalized. 

Republican Trump supporters are being screamed at in public by deranged Democrats who have been brainwashed into hating Trump. 

Republican Trump supporters are having their lives destroyed for walking into an open door at the Capitol on J6, by and large because of your lies and illegal activities. 

If anyone is secretly voting for a candidate because they are afraid to say so, it is Democrats and Independents that are voting for Trump. 

Your lies are becoming more and more ridiculous. You and your fellow Democrats are the true fascists here.","Mon Oct 28 14:00:20 +0000 2024"

Trump is just using crypto as a talking point for his presidential campaign. He has no clue about how any of it works and what makes it valuable. All he has done with crypto so far was to use his brand to grift people with shitty NFT collections and now his god awful DeFi token. 

If gave two shits about any of crypto he would have talked about it on Joe Rogan's podcast, but he didn't  even mention his own recently launched project because it was such an embarrassing failure. Even Trump haters didn't imagine how much of an dogshit grift that turned to be.

""I will build a wall, and Mexico will pay for it.""

No he won't, and no he didn't.

""Congress didn't get him the money for the wall.""

He got 150% of the TOP end budget he presented during his election campaign. Besides that, the wall was a waste of money as illegal immigration was surging at the end of Trump's term and during the first few months of Biden's (before he enacted any policies to make the problem even worse).

""I will eliminate income tax and substitute it with tariffs.""

No he won't. And no one who is parroting this incredibly absurd policy proposal has even the slightest clue about how much tariffs would need to be set to in order to eliminate the income tax and working towards a balanced the budget.

TLDR; Trump is full of shit, so don't expect much from his campaign promises.","Mon Oct 28 18:22:03 +0000 2024"

1.  LA Times refused to endorse a candidate first time in 20 years. 

2.  WAPO (Bezos) refusing to endorse Kamala. Bezos wants more conservative writers at WAPO. 

3.  Celebrity endorsements are backfiring instead of working like they once did. 

4.  Trump’s ONE interview with Rogan got more views than all of Kamala’s interviews did COMBINED. 

5.  Mainstream media stopped talking policies instead using fear porn to win.  (Nazi + Hilter)

6.  Republicans are leading early voting which rarely happens. 

7.  Tech CEO’s are calling Trump, not Harris.  (Tim Cook) 

8.  European stocks have dropped 7% since late September due to fear of Trump’s Tariffs.  

9.  Democrats are losing both the Jewish and the Muslim vote.  WOW!!!!! 

10.  Trump Rallies in Blue states bringing in record breaking attendance (Coachella 100k + MSG record breaking attendance) 

11.  Kamala has lost the black vote.  She’s doing worst than Clinton, Obama, Hilary or Biden…. And she’s ‘allegedly’ black.  

12.  AOC and Tim Waltz playing Madden streaming on Twitch.  Final score ended 0-0.  Desperation at the highest level.  

13.  From April to September Trump branded merch on amazon sold $140m versus $26m of Kamala.  

14.  Steel workers union in Pennsylvania endorsed Trump. Border patrol union endorses Trump 

15.  Last but not least, Putin endorsed Kamala.","Mon Oct 28 16:07:48 +0000 2024"

He's leveraging his status as some supposedly well-respected political scientist to decide who belongs within the boundaries of legitimate political discourse and who doesn’t.

But in doing so, Sabato is actually intensifying the very divide he regularly decries. By declaring Trump’s supporters as anathema and linking them to the Nazis, he's explicitly casting them as a kind of existential threat. 

And when you treat a political opponent as something to be feared, something beyond the pale, you leave no room for engagement or dialogue.

This is precisely how otherwise normal political divisions deepen into open hostility. One side feels persecuted by another which claims to merely be fighting for ""basic human decency"" when, in reality, they're pushing for their own explicitly political ends.

As Carl Schmitt once said, ""Whoever invokes humanity wants to cheat.""

Sabato's unhinged diatribes on Twitter reveal that all attempts to pretend there is a ""neutral"" objective center ultimately only heighten division because it deludes people into thinking they’re above the political. 

But no one really is.

When ""experts"" like Sabato disguise their rampant partisanship as impartial commentary and thoughtful observation, they create an illusion of moral superiority by casting the other side as irrational, dangerous, or even outright evil. 

He claims to fear extreme, divisive rhetoric, all while simultaneously fueling the exact conditions that are making real hostility inevitable.

Not only is it true, I’m not alone either.
