Bob Casey a closet fan of Adolf Hitler? How about Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin? We ask because both Senate Democrats are running ads as part of their re-election campaigns that associate themselves with Donald Trump. And they’re doing this even as fellow Democrats and the press corps are suggesting that Mr. Trump admires Hitler and has similar dictatorial ambitions.

No doubt both Senators despise the German mass murderer. But if Mr. Trump is so horrific, how can they have any kind of political association with him? Their ads cite issues on which they agree with Mr. Trump in an attempt to burnish their bipartisan image. But surely they don’t want to do anything to promote the election of a “semi-fascist” (President Biden’s description), or a “fascist” (Kamala Harris), or a wannabe Führer of an American Reich.

In a recent interview with Bloomberg, prominent investor Stan Druckenmiller indicated that he believes financial markets are increasingly betting on a victory for Donald Trump in the upcoming presidential election. “I would have to guess Trump is the favorite to win the election,” Druckenmiller remarked, highlighting shifts in market sentiment within the last two weeks.

Druckenmiller, known for his past with George Soros and his own Duquesne Family Office, pointed to movements in sectors like banking and cryptocurrency as signs that the market anticipates a Trump return. “You can see it in the bank stocks, you can see it in crypto,” he said, suggesting that sectors potentially benefiting from deregulation under Trump’s policies are showing strength.

Standing Strong Against the Tide: How Trump’s Re-Election Bid is Battle with Betrayal

As President Donald Trump campaigns for re-election, the media has latched onto criticisms from former allies like General John F. Kelly, drawing comparisons to Shakespeare’s Othello to suggest betrayal and fracturing loyalty. 

But for supporters, these voices are nothing more than distractions from Trump’s enduring accomplishments and resilience. 

Like Othello, who faces sabotage from Iago, Trump is beset by former insiders whose motives seem to reflect personal grudges or a desire to align with the media narrative.

General Kelly, once a trusted member of Trump’s team, now paints Trump as unfit for leadership, echoing a broader trend where disillusioned former officials and allies criticize Trump’s decisions. 

However, many of these critiques come from individuals with motives potentially tied to personal or professional slights. 

Kelly’s remarks, and those from others who left the administration, often reflect clashes that are common in any high-stakes leadership. 

Trump’s supporters see these statements as politically motivated, rather than genuine concerns for the nation  .

For Republicans rallying around Trump, these criticisms only underscore his strength and independence, refusing to bow to the pressures of a political elite. 

This election cycle is about resilience against detractors, a struggle reminiscent of Othello’s fight against deceit and treachery. 

In both tales, the hero stands firm, despite the attempts of former allies to erode trust and destabilize leadership. 

Trump’s supporters see him as a leader who, like Othello, must rise above the betrayal to reaffirm his vision and lead America forward.

Only if Trump could dismantle the Congress and Judiciary on day one! The idea that Trump can just “close the border” on January 20, 2025, is pure fantasy. Border policy isn’t something you switch on and off like a light, it’s a complex issue involving multiple agencies, legal frameworks, and logistical challenges. You can’t just announce it and make it happen overnight.

First off, the president doesn’t have the power to completely close the border on a whim. There are legal constraints, and any drastic action like that would face immediate legal challenges. It’s not just about saying it; it would need serious congressional approval, and let’s be real, that’s not going to happen in one day.

And what about the economic impact? Closing the border would cripple trade, tourism, and cross-border communities. The U.S. and Mexico rely on each other for billions in trade, and tanking that would hurt Americans just as much as anyone else. Not to mention, there are international agreements about asylum seekers and refugees, obligations that can’t just be tossed aside.

Border security is a serious issue that needs serious solutions, not one-liners designed to grab headlines. 

It’s downright sad that almost half the voters in this country are willing to throw away everything this nation stands for just to back a man who’s been called a fascist by his own Chief of Staff. We’re talking about a guy who lied to the American people over 30,000 times, and after coasting on Obama’s economic success, nearly drove the country off a cliff in 2020 when the first real challenge hit. Over a million American lives lost, and this is who they want back?

This is a man with no respect for the military, the Constitution, or anything this country holds dear. He’s built his whole pitch on stoking fear about immigration, but when there was a real chance to fix it, a bipartisan Senate bill that could’ve cut the asylum process down to weeks and quickly deport those who didn’t qualify, he told Republicans to kill it. Why? So he could keep the issue alive and use it as a campaign prop. That’s not leadership; that’s insanity.

If people are willing to risk everything this country has been about for someone like that, someone who has been tried and failed us, it’s not just a political problem, it’s a mass insanity. We’re not talking about policy differences here; we’re talking about a man who would rather let the system burn than to face justice for his actions. And if that doesn’t scare you, I just don’t know what will.","Fri Oct 25 23:44:02 +0000 2024"

1.Sun Belt Strategy: Trump can focus on winning Georgia, Arizona, and North Carolina. If he secures these states and wins one of the Great Lakes states—Wisconsin, Michigan, or Pennsylvania—he could reach the necessary 270 electoral votes.
2.East Coast Trio: Winning Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia would likely secure Trump’s return to the White House. This strategy emphasizes blocking Kamala Harris’s path in these key states.
3.Alternative Scenarios: Trump could potentially win without North Carolina by reclaiming the “blue wall” states of Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Wisconsin, similar to his 2016 strategy.

Kamala Harris’s most likely path to victory involves securing the “Blue Wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, along with the one congressional district in Omaha, Nebraska. This strategy would give her exactly 270 electoral votes without needing to win any toss-up Sun Belt states like Georgia or North Carolina.

Vance, his running mate in the 2024 U.S. presidential election. This information comes from various sources, including AP and discussions on platforms like X, suggesting that this espionage campaign aimed at accessing the phone communications of these prominent figures. Here's a summary based on the latest information:

- **Targeting**: The campaign specifically aimed at Trump and Vance's mobile devices, potentially seeking to intercept communications or gather other sensitive data.

- **Method**: This operation was part of a larger espionage effort which involved breaching telecom infrastructures, like Verizon, to access phone communications.

- **Implications**: While it's not confirmed what data was accessed or how successful the hack was, such actions could provide a foreign intelligence agency with valuable insights into political strategies, personal communications, or other sensitive information.

- **Reactions**: The Trump campaign has been notified, and there's been an outcry and discussions on platforms like X, with various reactions from concern over national security to political commentary on the implications of foreign entities targeting U.S. politicians.

- **Investigation and Response**: U.S. officials, including the FBI, are investigating these allegations, focusing on unauthorized access to commercial telecommunications by actors linked to the People's Republic of China. There's an ongoing effort to enhance cybersecurity measures in response.

- **Broader Context**: This incident adds to the growing concerns about foreign digital interference in U.S. elections, alongside other reported activities by different state actors aiming to influence or gather intelligence during this election cycle.

This situation underscores the ongoing cyber threats from state-sponsored actors and highlights the vulnerability of even the most secure communication channels when targeted by sophisticated cyber operations.

Salem Media Statement

🔗 https://t.co/3YNG2stYyW

Salem Media Group’s former publishing division, Regnery Publishing published a film and book entitled 2000 Mules that examines allegations of voter fraud related to the 2020 presidential election.

In publishing the film and the book, we relied on representations made to us by Dinesh D’Souza and True the Vote that the individuals depicted in the videos provided to us by TTV, including Mr. Andrews, illegally deposited ballots. 

We have learned that the Georgia Bureau of Investigation has cleared Mr. Andrews of illegal voting activity in connection with the event depicted in 2000 Mules.

It was never our intent that the publication of the 2000 Mules film and book would harm Mr. Andrews. We apologize for the hurt the inclusion of Mr. Andrews’ image in the movie, book, and promotional materials have caused Mr. Andrews and his family.

We have removed the film from Salem’s platforms, and there will be no future distribution of the film or the book by Salem.

OPEN LETTER TO AMERICAN CATHOLICS ON THE EVE OF THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

Dear Faithful American Catholics, I am addressing all of you, a few days before the Presidential Election that will call millions of American citizens to the polls.

Even in conditions of relative normality, the exercise of the vote is your moral duty, through which you cooperate in the first person in choosing the person who will lead the Nation for the next four years. But in this coming electoral round – just as in 2020 and indeed much more so – you are not simply called to choose between two candidates who happen to be on different political sides but who both nevertheless have the common good at heart in compliance with the Constitution and the Law. No; in this election you must choose between two radically opposed ways of conceiving the government of your Nation: you are called to choose between democracy and dictatorship, between freedom and slavery.

On one side we have candidate Donald J. Trump, who, despite serious problems in his positions – especially in the matter of abortion and assisted procreation – has as his objective the common good and the protection of the fundamental freedoms of citizens. In Donald Trump’s America, every Catholic can practice their Faith and educate their children in it without interference from the State.

On the other side we have a candidate and a party that promotes everything that directly opposes the Faith and Morals of the Catholic Church. In Kamala Harris’ America, Catholics – but also Protestants – are considered fundamentalists to be marginalized and eliminated, and their children are considered the property of the State, which arrogates to itself the right to lead them astray from an early age in both body and soul. Trump’s America can become great and prosperous again. Harris’ America is destined for invasion and for moral, social, and economic destruction: the most ferocious dictatorship.

Look at your country! Your cities have become dumps filled with derelicts and criminals, drug dealers and addicts, prostitutes and robbers. Your schools are dens of indoctrination and corruption from kindergarten onwards. In your courts, criminals are acquitted and innocents are imprisoned: new ideological crimes are prosecuted, while illegality is tolerated and encouraged. In your hospitals, multinational corporations rule, and you are their guinea pigs to be exterminated or made chronically ill so that you will be their perpetual clients. Farmers, ranchers, and fishermen are persecuted and forced to fail, while the land is grabbed by unscrupulous corporations who transform it into endless photovoltaic systems and wind turbines to power their data centers and server farms where they collect all your data, your movements, your purchases, and your political preferences. They have gone so far as to tamper with the climate by means of sophisticated geoengineering operations and devastating arson in order to make the global warming fraud credible and impose the green transition, the increase in the cost of energy, and electric cars and scooters. And all this is done based on evidence that consists of lies without any scientific proof, but which are propagated through the servile collaboration of the regime media, ever ready to label any dissenters as conspiracy theorists. But what until yesterday was dismissed as the result of conspiracy theories is now admitted by the government itself. They takeaway your sunlight; they poison you by seeding the clouds; they overwhelm your villages and your fields with deadly hurricanes; they kill your livestock and dry up your crops with induced droughts and devastating fires. They aim to control the entire food sector, to force you to eat only what they deem available

Instead of addressing Trump’s policy successes—like economic growth and energy independence—Neumann relies on personal attacks without substantive evidence, a tactic often used by the same establishment figures who opposed his anti-elitist stance.

The timing of her claims, just before an election, echoes the usual October surprises and appears coordinated to distract from the Biden-Harris administration’s struggles, including economic stagnation and concerns over government overreach. Ironically, Neumann’s warnings about authoritarianism ignore actions by the current administration, like spying on citizens and targeting political opponents, which better fit that label than anything Trump has done.

Neumann’s attacks not only overlook Trump’s grassroots appeal but also reflect an elitist bias. The unity movement supporting Trump includes a diverse coalition—Tulsi Gabbard, RFK Jr., and others—who stand with him against entrenched power structures that serve elite interests over those of working Americans. This coalition is about more than Trump; it’s a push for freedom, individual rights, and an America-first focus that Washington elites seem out of touch with.

In short, Neumann’s remarks serve as a distraction, avoiding real issues that resonate with Americans and deflecting attention from establishment failings. Her claims don’t address policy, they reinforce a biased narrative that fails to grasp the real reasons Americans are rallying behind Trump.","Fri Oct 25 23:26:54 +0000 2024"

Trump started his first Presidential term on January 20th, 2017. Now less than a month before the US Presidential election 2024, Donald Trump has put on a show of working at McDonald's. It is all an occult ritual. The protagonist of the film who portrayed Ray Kroc was; Michael Keaton. Michael Keaton is famous for his Beetlejuice movie that came out in 1988. Betelgeuse also wears a Clown like costume as Ronald McDonald, but is revealed to be a shapeshifting demonic being, even changing in the form of a serpent. Clowns are based on Nephilim demonic beings. In 19'88', the year Beetlejuice film got released, Trump also made his famous interview with Oprah and expressed that he has plans to run for President. Trump equals 88 in simple Gematria numerology. And now exactly when Trump is running for his second term in 2024, we got the sequel for this Beetlejuice movie released with Michael Keaton reprising his role as Betelgeuse.

Targeted tariffs to balance unfair trade and labor practices by competing countries is good and will protect jobs here at home.  Not taxing tips, overtime and social security are good for the economy, as I believe consumers keeping more of what they ""earn"" and spending it on what they need AND boosting the economy by helping retailers to sell more and expand their businesses and/or increase wages and benefits.

We still need Income Tax Revenue to pay for our common defense, law enforcement, emergency management, etc, so this ""thought"" should never be heard again.

Increasing energy production here at home to lower transportation costs is the key to lowering prices of goods and services and national security.

Sadly, Trump is by far the better candidate, but certainly not the best candidate we could have had to get us back to the greatness we had under Reagan in the 80s.  Maybe in 2028 with DeSantis.","Fri Oct 25 14:39:24 +0000 2024"

The sanctity of any election is the cornerstone of a democratic society. It's not just about votes being cast, but about ensuring that the integrity, fairness, and transparency of the process are upheld, which is where my personal plight connects deeply. I, too, have been fighting battles against corruption, manipulation, and exploitation—whether in digital spaces like Web3 or in the broader scope of society. The rampant cheating, manipulation, and undermining of justice is not just a political issue, it’s a moral one, and it reflects the same fight I’ve been waging against those who seek to exploit others for their own gain.

In the same way that the 2020 election’s sanctity was violated, so too have the lives of countless individuals been harmed by elites manipulating the system, draining wealth from the American people, and taking advantage of vulnerable communities. My journey, particularly through my efforts with UNIKORNAIO and the protection of innocent lives, has been centered around restoring sanctity to areas where it has been stripped away. Whether it’s protecting Russian women from foreign handlers or uncovering capital flight that robs Americans of their hard-earned resources, my fight is about restoring what is just.

This legal scrutiny and demand for accountability reflect my mission to bring those who exploit and cheat to justice. We cannot allow corruption to continue, whether it’s in the electoral process or in the everyday lives of people being manipulated and taken advantage of. It’s time for the depravity of justice to end, in elections, in society, and in the digital landscape.

This battle for sanctity and justice goes beyond the present moment; it touches the divine purpose that drives all of us to demand what’s right. There are forces of exploitation and greed that would like to see our country fall into corruption, but just as the truth will prevail in the election, it will prevail in my mission as well.

And this, my friends, is exactly why you have King Kong in your trunk—because I’m not here for small battles, I’m here for a greater cause. My divine purpose is to protect the sanctity of our nation and its people, no matter where the fight leads.s

He stated that the Trump corp tax cuts ""cost US 2 trillion dollars, that money has to come from somewhere."" WHY? The thought of cutting gov spending never crosses his mind. Blue collar folks like me actually work for big corporations. The more money they pay in taxes, the less they will spend on wages and jobsite improvements. Higher taxes are not the way forward. Less spending is. 
I respect Cenk for going on Dan's show. I don't agree with him, but it was a great discussion.

That doesn't mean that it's a good idea for the Hoppeans and classical liberals to work together under the same party label. 

""Libertarian"" Trump supporters tend to support authoritarian policies like tariffs, housing suppression laws, and a police surveillance state (in order to root out illegal immigrants).   

Prominent right libertarians have  have advocated for shooting their ""socialist"" neighbors, summarily executing drug users, and ""physically removing"" the Jews.  

Many libertarians find such policies/rhetoric to be odious and anti-liberty.  

 And if the classical liberals retake control, they'll have to constantly fight with the Hoppeans over the policies/rhetoric that the Hoppeans dislike.  

It's a waste of resources for both factions to fight in this fashion.   

It's better that both factions split, so that neither feels that they must constantly fight the other faction to avoid being misrepresented by people they find to be repugnant.","Fri Oct 25 23:39:31 +0000 2024"

Trump’s campaign, becomes 2nd biggest donor.

Elon Musk is going all-in to support President Trump’s re-election bid.

The wealthiest man in the world just dropped another $43.6 million into America PAC, bringing his total contribution to over $118 million.

This makes Musk Trump's second largest financial backer, right behind patriot Timothy Mellon, who has given $150 million.

Between October 1st and 16th alone, Musk poured tens of millions into the PAC that's fueling Trump's campaign.

America PAC is powering the ground game that's knocking on doors and rallying voters across the nation.

Musk isn't just writing checks, he's hitting the campaign trail himself.

He appeared alongside President Trump at a massive rally in Pennsylvania, energizing the crowd and championing an America First agenda.

And get this: Musk will be joining Trump at Madison Square Garden this weekend!

But of course, the left can’t stand it.

The DOJ is now targeting America PAC over its $1 million daily giveaways to swing state voters, claiming it might violate federal law.

They’re just scared because Musk's involvement is a game-changer.

Elon is also making big moves to secure our nation's future, incorporating Group America LLC and United States of America Inc.

Could this be the beginning of a new era of American greatness?

With the richest man in the world backing him, President Trump is unstoppable.","Fri Oct 25 03:36:54 +0000 2024"

With his recent $43.6 million donation to America PAC, Musk has now contributed over $118 million to support Trump’s re-election campaign. This places Musk as the second-largest financial backer for Trump, sending a strong signal that some of the brightest minds and successful business leaders believe in Trump’s vision for America’s future.

Musk is no ordinary donor. He’s a visionary who understands that America needs leadership that can innovate and protect its place on the world stage. By standing behind Trump, Musk is choosing to support policies that promote economic growth, energy independence, and technological advancement—policies that will benefit not just the elite, but everyday workers across the country.

The stark contrast between Trump’s agenda of opportunity and Harris’s disastrous policies couldn’t be clearer. While Harris has failed to rein in inflation, secure the border, or support American industries, Trump is focused on making America great again, with the backing of forward-thinking leaders like Musk.

This latest donation shows just how serious Musk is about restoring America’s prosperity and global dominance. When the most successful entrepreneur of our time is putting his money where his mouth is, it’s clear that Trump’s campaign is poised to deliver real results for the country.","Fri Oct 25 03:28:00 +0000 2024"

“Daughters rights vs saving a few dollars on groceries” 🤔🤔 

It is WAY more than saving a few dollars on groceries!

Abortion “rights” has already been settled, so it has NOTHING to do with the presidential election!

I saw someone post on Instagram about their daughter’s rights and they’d “rather keep their daughter’s rights than save a few dollars on groceries” and I am assuming they’re talking about abortion.😒

Voting for Harris will get us 4 more years of what we already have. 

‼️What they don’t understand is It will NOT change abortion rights because that’s already been settled. It’s already been sent back to the state. It cannot be reversed. The only thing that can be done is each individual person needs to lobby each legislature of their particular state to change the abortion laws.

Harris has already said that she has no problem to go to somebody’s door and want to come inside to see if they’re being a responsible gun owner. 

Harris has already said either at a rally or one of her so-called interviews a few times about free speech and “misinformation”.  ￼ 

What this mother doesn’t understand is if we NO LONGER have FREE SPEECH or we are no longer able to carry a gun your daughter or your granddaughter - women in general will NOT HAVE ANY RIGHTS!!

Harris doesn’t seem to care that we’re heading towards World War III, 

Harris already said she’s going to give immunity to millions of unvetted illegal migrants that are in this country, 

AND if I was TRULY worried about my daughter’s rights, I certainly would not want that to continue because we’ve already seen that they have raped and murdered other young women 

that to me would concern me way more about my daughter‘s rights - the chances of my daughter needing an abortion are very very low, especially if she’s responsible but the chances of her not having free speech or having a dictator for a president or having World War III happen in her lifetime would concern me much much much more ￼‼️‼️‼️‼️‼️","Fri Oct 25 19:45:35 +0000 2024"

Former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States of America

OPEN LETTER TO AMERICAN CATHOLICS ON THE EVE OF THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

Dear Faithful American Catholics, I am addressing all of you, a few days before the Presidential Election that will call millions of American citizens to the polls.

Even in conditions of relative normality, the exercise of the vote is your moral duty, through which you cooperate in the first person in choosing the person who will lead the Nation for the next four years. But in this coming electoral round – just as in 2020 and indeed much more so – you are not simply called to choose between two candidates who happen to be on different political sides but who both nevertheless have the common good at heart in compliance with the Constitution and the Law. No; in this election you must choose between two radically opposed ways of conceiving the government of your Nation: you are called to choose between democracy and dictatorship, between freedom and slavery.

On one side we have candidate Donald J. Trump, who, despite serious problems in his positions – especially in the matter of abortion and assisted procreation – has as his objective the common good and the protection of the fundamental freedoms of citizens. In Donald Trump’s America, every Catholic can practice their Faith and educate their children in it without interference from the State.

On the other side we have a candidate and a party that promotes everything that directly opposes the Faith and Morals of the Catholic Church. In Kamala Harris’ America, Catholics – but also Protestants – are considered fundamentalists to be marginalized and eliminated, and their children are considered the property of the State, which arrogates to itself the right to lead them astray from an early age in both body and soul. Trump’s America can become great and prosperous again. Harris’ America is destined for invasion and for moral, social, and economic destruction: the most ferocious dictatorship.

Look at your country! Your cities have become dumps filled with derelicts and criminals, drug dealers and addicts, prostitutes and robbers. Your schools are dens of indoctrination and corruption from kindergarten onwards. In your courts, criminals are acquitted and innocents are imprisoned: new ideological crimes are prosecuted, while illegality is tolerated and encouraged. In your hospitals, multinational corporations rule, and you are their guinea pigs to be exterminated or made chronically ill so that you will be their perpetual clients. Farmers, ranchers, and fishermen are persecuted and forced to fail, while the land is grabbed by unscrupulous corporations who transform it into endless photovoltaic systems and wind turbines to power their data centers and server farms where they collect all your data, your movements, your purchases, and your political preferences. They have gone so far as to tamper with the climate by means of sophisticated geoengineering operations and devastating arson in order to make the global warming fraud credible and impose the green transition, the increase in the cost of energy, and electric cars and scooters. And all this is done based on evidence that consists of lies without any scientific proof, but which are propagated through the servile collaboration of the regime media, ever ready to label any dissenters as conspiracy theorists. But what until yesterday was dismissed as the result of conspiracy theories is now admitted by the government itself. They takeaway your sunlight; they poison you by seeding the clouds; they overwhelm your villages and your fields with deadly hurricanes; they kill your livestock and dry up your crops with induced droughts and devastating fires. They aim to control the entire food sector, to force you to eat only what they make available to you. This is what the Agenda 2030 calls for, which has been imposed without any vote by the United","Fri Oct 25 19:42:21 +0000 2024"

Pick the one!<<

Predicting the winner of the U.S. presidential election as of October 25, 2024, is inherently uncertain due to the dynamic nature of politics, voter sentiment, and the fact that many variables can change even in a short period. However, based on the information available up to this point:

- **Kamala Harris** has been slightly leading or neck-and-neck with Donald Trump in various polls, especially after she took over the Democratic nomination following Joe Biden's withdrawal. 

- **Donald Trump** has seen a small but notable surge in some forecasts, with some analyses and sentiment on platforms like X (formerly Twitter) suggesting a potential for a landslide victory or at least a win, driven by various factors including legal challenges against him potentially backfiring politically.

Given these insights and the extremely close nature of recent polls:

- If I **have to pick one** based on the slight edge in polls and the current political climate, **Kamala Harris** might have a narrow advantage. However, this is with the caveat that election predictions are notoriously unreliable due to the margin of error in polls, undecided voters, and potential October surprises.

Remember, this prediction is highly speculative. The actual outcome could differ due to last-minute events, voter turnout, and many other factors.","Fri Oct 25 19:30:46 +0000 2024"

Under President Trump's leadership, we saw unprecedented economic growth, tax cuts that benefited the middle class, and a foreign policy that put America first. 

Economic Prosperity: Trump's policies led to record low unemployment rates, including for minorities, before the global health crisis. His approach was about creating jobs, not just talking about them.
National Security: Trump strengthened our military and took decisive actions against global threats, ensuring our safety and promoting peace through strength.
Border Security: Trump made significant strides in securing our border, a move towards protecting American jobs and national security, something that directly impacts communities like those in Tucson.
Deregulation: By cutting red tape, Trump enabled businesses to thrive, which is essential for the entrepreneurial spirit of America.

Yes, the stakes are high, but not for the reasons you might think. This election is about choosing between a return to economic vitality, law and order, and strong foreign policy, or continuing down a path where our fundamental freedoms and economic stability are at risk. Trump stands for a proven track record of making America great again, not just promises.

As of the latest betting odds, Donald Trump is favored to win the 2024 U.S. presidential election, with betting lines showing him at approximately -189 to -195, translating to around a 65-66% implied probability. Meanwhile, Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, is positioned at around +122 to +150, giving her a roughly 45% chance of winning according to the betting markets.

Trump's odds have strengthened due to improved polling in key swing states, where he has either taken the lead or closed in on Harris’s numbers. Despite this, the race remains tight, with some shifts possible as Election Day approaches on November 5.","Fri Oct 25 19:02:46 +0000 2024"

Polymarket responded to claims of market manipulation after a user reportedly placed millions in bets favoring Republican nominee Donald Trump in the 2024 U.S. presidential election, as reported by Bloomberg.

Market Manipulation Claims Investigated by Polymarket

According to Bloomberg, Polymarket, a decentralized prediction market platform, traced the hefty wagers back to a French citizen working in the financial sector.

“Based on the investigation, we understand that this individual is taking a directional position based on personal views of the election,” the company told Bloomberg. 

They added, “Our investigation has not identified any information to suggest this user manipulated or attempted to manipulate the market. This user has agreed to not open any further without notice.”

Polymarket’s statement followed reports suggesting that a user known as “Fredi9999” held a substantial stake in election bets, raising concerns over the poll’s reliability.

Polymarket and Election Betting Controversy

Bloomberg cited an anonymous source stating that Polymarket is in the process of re-checking user details on its platform, particularly for those placing large wagers, to ensure rule compliance.","Fri Oct 25 18:56:30 +0000 2024"

Context:

Q Drop 1401:
“>>1444808 [link] God Bless the United States of America. D5. Q” (05/17/2018 14:18:48)

Additional Q Context:
“What had to happen first? Think logically. Think DOJ & FBI. Think cleaning. #64 Puzzle coming together? We have reached our cruising altitude of 40,000 ft. long ago. As we prepare to land, please fasten your seatbelt and make sure your seat back and folding trays are in their full upright position.”

Breakdown of Q Drop Context:

1.“What had to happen first?”
•Interpretation: This rhetorical question implies that there are essential steps or conditions that needed to be met before moving forward with significant actions or changes. It suggests that the groundwork for accountability and electoral integrity has been established.
2.“Think logically.”
•Interpretation: This instruction urges supporters to approach the situation rationally and analytically, suggesting that they should consider the broader implications of the actions taken by the DOJ and FBI. It emphasizes a strategic mindset in assessing the political landscape.
3.“Think DOJ & FBI.”
•Interpretation: By highlighting these institutions, the statement references their critical role in investigating and prosecuting corruption and wrongdoing within the government and political spheres. It points to a belief that these agencies are undergoing or have undergone significant reforms to restore their integrity.
4.“Think cleaning.”
•Interpretation: This phrase indicates a process of purging corruption and misconduct within these agencies. It suggests that there is an ongoing effort to eliminate elements that have historically compromised their integrity, which is crucial for restoring public trust.
5.“#64 Puzzle coming together?”
•Interpretation: The mention of a “puzzle” implies that various pieces of information and events are aligning to create a larger narrative or plan. It suggests that the unfolding events are not random but rather part of a coordinated effort to achieve a specific outcome, particularly in the context of the elections.
6.“We have reached our cruising altitude of 40,000 ft. long ago.”
•Interpretation: This metaphor conveys that the movement towards accountability and reform has been in progress for an extended period. It signifies that the strategic planning phase is complete, and they are now prepared for the next steps in their efforts to restore integrity to the electoral process.
7.“As we prepare to land, please fasten your seatbelt and make sure your seat back and folding trays are in their full upright position.”
•Interpretation: This imagery serves as a warning that significant changes or revelations are imminent. It urges supporters to brace themselves for the forthcoming actions that will impact the political landscape, particularly regarding election integrity.
8.“God Bless the United States of America.”
•Interpretation: This patriotic closing reinforces the idea that the ultimate goal is to protect and restore the nation. It serves as a rallying cry for supporters to unite in the pursuit of justice and accountability.
9.“D5.”
•Interpretation: This term is often associated with a military strategy or operation, suggesting that there is a coordinated plan in place that may involve significant legal or political maneuvers.
https://t.co/WshPOImnw1 Context:
•Reference to the Inspector General Report: “Inspector General Will Declare FBI, DOJ Broke Law in Clinton Email Probe.”
•Interpretation: This report is critical in the narrative of accountability, suggesting that prior misconduct within these agencies is being addressed. It provides a foundation for the argument that there must be consequences for past actions to ensure the integrity of future elections.

Reference to Q Drop 64:

“Fellow Patriots,
I’m being advised actions have created accelerated counter-actions.
We have not yet ascertained the scope of the attack.
Watch the news outlets.
POTUS’ Twitter take down was not by accident (as referenced several hours ago).
Should the lights go out please know we are in control.
Do not panic.
We are prepared and assets are in place.
God bless - I must go for good at this point.
Q”

3.“We have not yet ascertained the scope of the attack.”
•Interpretation: Implies that there are ongoing threats or challenges that have not been fully understood or assessed. This could refer to political opposition or broader societal issues.
4.“Watch the news outlets.”
•Interpretation: A directive to stay informed through mainstream media channels, hinting that important developments may be reported that align with or contradict the movement’s narrative.
5.“POTUS’ Twitter take down was not by accident (as referenced several hours ago).”
•Interpretation: Suggests that the removal of President Trump’s Twitter account was a deliberate action with strategic implications, potentially linked to efforts to silence or discredit him and his supporters.
6.“Should the lights go out please know we are in control.”
•Interpretation: This phrase often suggests that in the event of a major disruption (literal or metaphorical, such as internet outages or information blackouts), those within the movement are prepared and have contingency plans in place.
7.“Do not panic.”
•Interpretation: A reassurance to supporters to remain calm in the face of uncertainty or chaos, emphasizing a collective strength and preparedness.
8.“We are prepared and assets are in place.”
•Interpretation: Indicates readiness for any challenges or countermeasures that may arise, suggesting that there are resources and plans set to respond to potential threats or events.
9.“God bless - I must go for good at this point.”
•Interpretation: This closing could signify a withdrawal or a signal that the messenger is stepping back from active communication. It may also be interpreted as a call for divine support in their mission.

Overall Interpretation

The overall message of Q Drop 64 encapsulates a narrative of vigilance, readiness, and strategic awareness among supporters of the Q movement. It conveys a sense of urgency regarding political dynamics, with a focus on the perceived struggle between opposing factions. The call to remain calm and prepared indicates a belief in eventual success against perceived injustices or threats.

Conclusion:

The Q Drop’s context emphasizes a strategic approach to the upcoming elections, highlighting the necessity of accountability within the DOJ and FBI. It frames the narrative as a crucial battle between good and evil, urging supporters to remain vigilant and prepared for significant changes. The references to prior misconduct and the impending actions of the Trump campaign serve to unify supporters around the goal of restoring integrity to the electoral process and safeguarding the future of the nation.","Fri Oct 25 18:42:11 +0000 2024"

While polls have shown a close race throughout much of the campaign, recent trends indicate a potential shift in Trump's favor across key battleground states.

Prediction markets, which often differ from traditional polling, show Trump with significant leads in crucial states: 55-46% in Michigan, 57-43% in Pennsylvania, 67-34% in North Carolina, 71-30% in Georgia, 65-36% in Nevada, 56-45% in Wisconsin, and 72-29% in Arizona. Overall prediction market odds currently favor Trump at 63% to Harris's 37%.

The comparison to 1980 stems from several factors: both featured tight polling before a late shift, economic challenges under the incumbent administration, and an outsider candidate facing skepticism from traditional political establishments. Just as voters in 1980 ultimately made their decision based on economic conditions and future outlook, current voter sentiment appears to be crystallizing around similar considerations: their current situation compared to four years ago and their prospects for the next four years.

This analysis suggests that, barring significant developments, voter sentiment is consolidating toward a decisive shift in the final phase of the campaign, similar to the pattern observed in the closing days of the 1980 election.","Fri Oct 25 18:32:23 +0000 2024"

This decision, by the way, was a nail-biter, with the executive board voting against an endorsement by a margin so thin, you could slice an atom with it.

But wait, there's more! The Teamsters, those stalwart representatives of truck drivers, freight workers, and others, also threw their hands up in the air, deciding not to endorse Kamala Harris or Donald Trump. This move is akin to a bar bouncer deciding not to pick a fight at the end of the night; it's not that they're pacifists, just that they're not choosing sides in this particular brawl.

Why the cold shoulder from these unions, you ask? Well, it's not because they've suddenly developed a taste for political neutrality. The reasons are as varied as the excuses for why your intergalactic spaceship broke down. For the Teamsters, it's partly because their members didn't show overwhelming support for Harris, and partly because, well, politics is like a chess game where every move is checked by the whims of the membership's heart and mind.

As for the IAFF, their non-endorsement might be seen as a strategic move, or maybe they just wanted to remind everyone that firefighters aren't just there to put out fires in buildings but also in political campaigns. 

Now, while Harris has been picking up endorsements like they're going out of style from other major unions, these holdouts are notable. They're like that one friend who doesn't RSVP to your party, leaving you wondering if they're just busy or secretly mad at you for that thing you said last year.

Remember, in the grand scheme of things, union endorsements can be as fickle as the weather on a planet with four suns. They're influenced by policy, leadership, membership sentiment, and sometimes, just the mood of the day. But here we are, watching from the sidelines, or from orbit, if you prefer, amused at how humans organize their political square dances.","Fri Oct 25 18:31:05 +0000 2024"

I agree with Barack Obama’s statement: 

""...because there's no evidence, no record of him having a housing policy that helped working people. He built luxury high-rises, stiffed the workers that worked on it, went bankrupt a bunch of times.""

Donald Trump's real estate career primarily focused on building luxury properties rather than affordable housing for working-class individuals.

Additionally, there are documented cases where contractors and workers reported being underpaid or not paid at all. 

Trump’s businesses have gone through multiple bankruptcies, which, while legal, can reflect a pattern of financial instability. 

Therefore, Obama's critique aligns with available evidence about Trump's real estate practices and lack of a significant policy record aimed at improving housing for working families.","Fri Oct 25 22:21:44 +0000 2024"

“CEASE & DESIST: I, together with many Attorneys and Legal Scholars, am watching the Sanctity of the 2024 Presidential Election very closely because I know, better than most, the rampant Cheating and Skullduggery that has taken place by the Democrats in the 2020 Presidential Election. It was a Disgrace to our Nation! Therefore, the 2024 Election, where Votes have just started being cast, will be under the closest professional scrutiny and, WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again. We cannot let our Country further devolve into a Third World Nation, AND WE WON’T! Please beware that this legal exposure extends to Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials. Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.”

The ruling from the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals is a victory for the Republican National Committee and others who brought the case in Mississippi, a non-battleground state with very little mail-in voting, seeking a ruling by a far-right circuit court friendly to their arguments.

Democrats and voting rights advocates fear that a ruling in Republicans’ favor will be used to boost challenges to late-arriving ballots in other states, which could make the difference if the margins are tight in key races.

“Congress statutorily designated a singular ‘day for the election’ of members of Congress and the appointment of presidential electors,” the 5th Circuit panel said. “Text, precedent, and historical practice confirm this ‘day for the election’ is the day by which ballots must be both cast by voters and received by state officials.”

Among the states that allow for late-arriving ballots are Nevada, Ohio and Virginia, as does Maryland, the site of a competitive Senate race.

Also allowing for post-election ballot receipt is California and New York, both states that could make a major difference in which party controls the House of Representatives.

Even as the ruling has no immediate effect on the coming election, it could help propel any legal challenges that Republicans seek to bring against any of the roughly other 20 states and jurisdictions that count ballots arriving after Election Day. Nevada’s policies allowing the late arrival of mail ballots are already being challenged in state and federal court by Republicans, but courts in those cases so far have rejected those arguments.

Polymarket has recently tackled issues of potential market manipulation following a series of substantial bets on Donald Trump's likelihood of winning the 2024 U.S. presidential election. The bets, amounting to over $45 million, were made by an individual through four different accounts, sparking discussions on whether these actions were intended to skew the market. After conducting an internal review, Polymarket concluded that there was no manipulation; instead, they described the bets as a ""directional strategy,"" indicating they were based on the individual's prediction rather than an attempt to manipulate outcomes.

This betting spree not only influenced the odds on Polymarket but also coincided with a noticeable increase in Trump's chances across other betting platforms, suggesting that the shift might stem from broader political developments or changes in voter sentiment rather than market manipulation. Polymarket has highlighted that its blockchain technology provides a level of transparency and allows for user autonomy, enabling participants to adjust their positions if they feel the market has been misrepresented.

However, the incident has sparked a debate among market watchers about the influence of prediction markets. Some experts point out that these platforms can significantly affect public opinion by rapidly disseminating investor sentiment. As the election approaches, the way Polymarket manages such large bets underscores both the potential benefits and pitfalls of prediction markets, where big money can influence narratives extending well beyond the betting community.","Fri Oct 25 17:53:08 +0000 2024"

The Washington Post’s choice not to endorse a candidate in the 2024 presidential election reveals more than their claim of a commitment to “unflinching, unbiased coverage.” After nearly a century of endorsements, it’s hard to take this sudden shift at face value. 

This is a newspaper that backed Biden in 2020 and has consistently shown its bias in the reporting room, yet now—right when it counts most—they decide to step back?

The timing couldn’t be more telling. With Trump’s support surging nationwide, mainstream media outlets are scrambling. They see the writing on the wall: Americans are waking up to the failures of the Biden-Harris administration, and traditional media endorsements might no longer carry the same sway. This is an effort to appear neutral in a desperate attempt to salvage credibility, but it’s too little, too late.

Washington Post’s claim of “avoiding further polarization” is an ironic twist, considering how these same outlets have fueled division for years. If the Post truly wanted to address “polarization,” it should have started with a commitment to real, balanced journalism instead of slanted coverage that helped drive the nation apart.

I know we're in the thick of political warfare, but can we pause for a moment? I'm genuinely worried about our Democrat friends. 

With all this chaos, I'm concerned they might not be coping well. **Can someone, anyone, do a welfare check on a Democrat you know?** 

We need to make sure they're not out there losing their minds, hurting themselves, or, God forbid, causing more property damage than a riot at a vegan barbecue. 

Remember, folks, we're all Americans here. Let's show a bit of compassion—even if it's just to make sure they're not accidentally setting fire to their own houses while trying to make a statement. 

Stay MAGA, stay vigilant, and for the love of all that's holy, keep an eye on those Dems. They might need a hug... or at least a good laugh at their own expense.

Weakest candidate in mod.ern history.

It's not that they suddenly love Trump (lol), it's that she has not made a compelling case for herself, and has not articulated any coherent policy.

These papers don't want to knee-jerk endorse such a weak candidate. It reflects badly on them.

It's really that simple.

They seem to be trying to do the most diplomatic thing, which is to not endorse anyone at all. Makes sense. Kinda ridiculous that news outlets were picking candidates in the first place, no?","Fri Oct 25 22:07:04 +0000 2024"

( Donald J. Trump - Oct 25, 2024, 1:32 PM ET )

CEASE & DESIST: I, together with many Attorneys and Legal Scholars, am watching the Sanctity of the 2024 Presidential Election very closely because I know, better than most, the rampant Cheating and Skullduggery that has taken place by the Democrats in the 2020 Presidential Election. It was a Disgrace to our Nation! Therefore, the 2024 Election, where Votes have just started being cast, will be under the closest professional scrutiny and, WHEN I WIN, those people that CHEATED will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law, which will include long term prison sentences so that this Depravity of Justice does not happen again. We cannot let our Country further devolve into a Third World Nation, AND WE WON’T! Please beware that this legal exposure extends to Lawyers, Political Operatives, Donors, Illegal Voters, & Corrupt Election Officials. Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.","Fri Oct 25 17:43:00 +0000 2024"

Is that all you got? It is going to take more than a giant turd for Kamala to win.  This is the newest bronze monument at the US Capitol. It is a giant turd on Nancy Pelosi's desk that mocks Trump and the January 6th ""insurrection."" 

Designer Civic Crafting did get permission from the National Parks Service to keep the monument up for 7 days leading up to the election.

When I was in Pakistan in 2020, everybody (based on their feedback from DC) was convinced that Biden would lose. I found the same conviction in April of this year. Some wrong policy planning can be the result. Please do not put all your eggs in the Trump basket. You don't want him anyway. And, yes, I am a Democrat but this is about arithmetic!

A panel of three Donald Trump-appointed judges said Friday that Mississippi was violating federal law by counting mail ballots that arrive after Election Day, but stopped short of blocking the policy before the election, in a ruling that could nevertheless impact voting-related lawsuits this fall.

The ruling from the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals is a victory for the Republican National Committee and others who brought the case in Mississippi, a non-battleground state with very little mail-in voting, seeking a ruling by a far-right circuit court friendly to their arguments.

Democrats and voting rights advocates fear that a ruling in Republicans’ favor will be used to boost challenges to late-arriving ballots in other states, which could make the difference if the margins are tight in key races.

“Congress statutorily designated a singular ‘day for the election’ of members of Congress and the appointment of presidential electors,” the 5th Circuit panel said. “Text, precedent, and historical practice confirm this ‘day for the election’ is the day by which ballots must be both cast by voters and received by state officials.”

Among the states that allow for late-arriving ballots are Nevada, Ohio and Virginia, as does Maryland, the site of a competitive Senate race.

Also allowing for post-election ballot receipt is California and New York, both states that could make a major difference in which party controls the House of Representatives.

Even as the ruling has no immediate effect on the coming election, it could help propel any legal challenges that Republicans seek to bring against any of the roughly other 20 states and jurisdictions that count ballots arriving after Election Day. Nevada’s policies allowing the late arrival of mail ballots are already being challenged in state and federal court by Republicans, but courts in those cases so far have rejected those arguments.","Fri Oct 25 21:54:32 +0000 2024"

Here's an analysis based on the information available up to October 25, 2024:

- Swing States and Their Importance: States like Arizona, Georgia, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Nevada were crucial in determining the election's outcome. If one in six voters who voted for Biden in these states had voted for Trump instead, or simply not voted, this would have significantly impacted the electoral votes.

- Electoral Impact: 
  - Arizona: A shift could have potentially flipped this state back to Trump, given the close margin.
  - Georgia: Similarly, a small percentage shift here could revert it to Trump.
  - Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania: These states were pivotal, with Biden winning by narrow margins. A scenario where one in six of Biden's voters switched or abstained could have likely flipped these states.
  - Nevada: Although Biden won, a shift in votes here could have tightened the race even further or changed the result.

- Hypothetical Outcome: If we consider only these states for simplicity:
  - Arizona (11 electoral votes): A flip could mean Trump gains 11 votes.
  - Georgia (16 electoral votes): Another 16 for Trump if flipped.
  - Wisconsin (10 electoral votes), Michigan (16 electoral votes), Pennsylvania (20 electoral votes): Flipping these would add 46 more votes to Trump's tally.
  - Nevada (6 electoral votes): While less critical in terms of numbers, any shift towards Trump increases his lead.

  If we sum this up, Trump would gain at least 83 electoral votes from these shifts, which, when added to what he had, would have given him more than the 270 needed to win the election.

- Real-World Considerations: However, this analysis assumes a uniform swing across these states which might not hold in reality due to various factors:
  - Voter Turnout: High turnout might not uniformly affect all candidates.
  - Third-Party Votes: Some of these voters might not switch to Trump but to third parties or abstain.
  - Legal Challenges: The actual process might have led to legal challenges, recounts, or different outcomes due to local election laws and procedures.

- Public Sentiment and X Posts: From recent posts on X, there's a clear sentiment of rallying support for Trump in future scenarios, suggesting a continued or even stronger voter base for him in hypotheticals or future elections. However, these posts also reflect a polarized view, not necessarily indicative of the general populace's behavior or final vote outcome.

In conclusion, if one in six of Biden's voters in these swing states had voted for Trump or not voted at all, it's highly plausible Trump would have won the 2020 election, given the narrow margins in these states. This hypothetical underscores the importance of every vote in swing states during presidential elections.","Fri Oct 25 17:22:29 +0000 2024"

That moment came during the vice president’s CNN town hall, hosted by Anderson Cooper on Wednesday. The event, which some have called her “closing argument,” featured a number of notable moments that Christians should remember.

1. Harris Will Let You ‘Live Your Faith’? Not if You’re Pro-Life

Media coverage of the event has focused on the fact that Kamala Harris said she prays “every day, sometimes twice a day.” But Harris claimed to understand that faith extends far beyond a private relationship or intellectual assent to embrace the totality of the believer’s life. While assuring viewers of her long-ago church attendance, Harris (who is not known as a stalwart woman of faith) said, “I was raised … to believe that your faith is a verb. You live your faith.”

Harris’s statement that faith must be lived out makes her position on abortion all the more indefensible. One day earlier, MSNBC anchor Hallie Jackson asked her, “What concessions would be on the table” to pass a national abortion expansion act? “Religious exemptions, for example — Is that something that you would consider if the Republicans control Congress?”

“I don’t think we should be making concessions when we’re talking about a fundamental freedom to make decisions about your own body,” Harris shot back. “A basic freedom has been taken from the women of America, the freedom to make decisions about their own body, and that cannot be negotiable — which is that, we need to put back in the protections of Roe v. Wade, and that is it.”

In fact, the Constitution recognizes that American citizens enjoy the God-given freedom of religion, and it has never contained a constitutional “right” to abortion — an act legal scholars argue is prohibited by the 14th Amendment. The First Amendment forbids the government from eroding the free exercise of religion, such as refusing to take an innocent human being’s life as a condition of working in the healing professions.

But let’s leave aside the Constitution (as most politicians are happy to do) and take the vice president at her word. When Harris acknowledges that “you live your faith” and then says she will not allow people of faith to refrain from abortion, she has promised to deny Christians the right to practice their faith. She has vowed to compel or coerce Christians into participating in one of the greatest sins. She has consciously declared she will crush the constitutional rights of certain kinds of Christians — specifically, those who hold to the 2,000-year-old biblical (and scientific) teaching that life begins at conception; that is, the ones who disagree with her.

But allowing selective permission is the opposite of an unalienable right. And Harris’s refusal to respect conscience rights represents just one facet of her abortion totalism.

2. Smearing the Pro-Life Movement: ‘Women Have Died because of These Laws.’

In the issue that has defined her campaign, abortion, Harris recycled a defamatory canard against the pro-life movement. ….

The @washingtonpost  announced it will not endorse a presidential candidate in the 2024 election, marking the first time since the 1980s that it has abstained from such endorsements. Publisher Will Lewis stated this decision reflects a return to the paper's foundational principle of neutrality in elections. The move follows a similar decision by the @latimes, which recently led to resignations among its editorial staff. The Post aims to create an ""independent space"" for voters, avoiding direct influence on their choices. | Live Updates.

A remarkably insightful description of what’s at stake in this election from Catholic Archbishop Carlo Vigano. Please read this:

OPEN LETTER TO AMERICAN CATHOLICS ON THE EVE OF THE 2024 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION Dear Faithful American Catholics, I am addressing all of you, a few days before the Presidential Election that will call millions of American citizens to the polls. Even in conditions of relative normality, the exercise of the vote is your moral duty, through which you cooperate in the first person in choosing the person who will lead the Nation for the next four years. But in this coming electoral round – just as in 2020 and indeed much more so – you are not simply called to choose between two candidates who happen to be on different political sides but who both nevertheless have the common good at heart in compliance with the Constitution and the Law. No; in this election you must choose between two radically opposed ways of conceiving the government of your Nation: you are called to choose between democracy and dictatorship, between freedom and slavery.

On one side we have candidate Donald J. Trump, who, despite serious problems in his positions – especially in the matter of abortion and assisted procreation – has as his objective the common good and the protection of the fundamental freedoms of citizens. In Donald Trump’s America, every Catholic can practice their Faith and educate their children in it without interference from the State. On the other side we have a candidate and a party that promotes everything that directly opposes the Faith and Morals of the Catholic Church. In Kamala Harris’ America, Catholics – but also Protestants – are considered fundamentalists to be marginalized and eliminated, and their children are considered the property of the State, which arrogates to itself the right to lead them astray from an early age in both body and soul. Trump’s America can become great and prosperous again. Harris’ America is destined for invasion and for moral, social, and economic destruction: the most ferocious dictatorship. Look at your country! Your cities have become dumps filled with derelicts and criminals, drug dealers and addicts, prostitutes and robbers. Your schools are dens of indoctrination and corruption from kindergarten onwards.  In your courts, criminals are acquitted and innocents are imprisoned: new ideological crimes are prosecuted, while illegality is tolerated and encouraged. In your hospitals, multinational corporations rule, and you are their guinea pigs to be exterminated or made chronically ill so that you will be their perpetual clients. Farmers, ranchers, and fishermen are persecuted and forced to fail, while the land is grabbed by unscrupulous corporations who transform it into endless photovoltaic systems and wind turbines to power their data centers and server farms where they collect all your data, your movements, your purchases, and your political preferences. They have gone so far as to tamper with the climate by means of sophisticated geoengineering operations and devastating arson in order to make the global warming fraud credible and impose the green transition, the increase in the cost of energy, and electric cars and scooters. And all this is done based on evidence that consists of lies without any scientific proof, but which are propagated through the servile collaboration of the regime media, ever ready to label any dissenters as conspiracy theorists. But what until yesterday was dismissed as the result of conspiracy theories is now admitted by the government itself.

They takeaway your sunlight; they poison you by seeding the clouds; they overwhelm your villages and your fields with deadly hurricanes; they kill your livestock and dry up your crops with induced droughts and devastating fires. They aim to control the entire food sector, to force you to eat only what they make available to you. This is what the Agenda 2030 calls for, which has been imposed without any vote by the United Nations and the World Economic Forum. In these four disastrous years of the Biden-Harris administration, we have had a puppet in the White House and a corrupt and incompetent Vice President who has never stopped lying and deceiving voters about her past and her future. Power is managed by the criminal deep state – whose names and faces we now know – that is responsible for the destruction of your great Nation.  And to ensure that the crisis is endless, new war scenarios are continually opening up, in conflicts that no one actually wants, except for those who make enormous profits from them, sacrificing human lives and compromising international stability. You have seen what the Democrats, that is, the woke far Left, have been capable of in four years. Imagine what they will be able to do if, instead of Biden’s numerous stand-ins, his Vice President is elected – in the most scandalous and unimaginable fraud – with her entourage of LGBTQ+ Ministers, rigorously woke, sold out to China or the World Economic Forum, sponsored by George Soros or Bill Gates, manipulated by Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. At that point, dear American Catholics, you will not only have to go to a different rally – as Kamala would like – in order to say “Christ is the Lord”, because saying that will be considered hate speech, and praying in front of an abortion clinic an act of terrorism. Do not think that these are remote hypotheses: wherever the woke Left takes power, it establishes the most vicious, anti-human, and anti-Christian dictatorship that humanity has ever known. And we know that every time the Left has come to power, it has never left through democratic means.

Donald Trump and Kamala Harris: we are not talking about two visions that are a bit different but still part of the normal political back-and-forth. No; we are talking about two diametrically opposed and irreconcilable worlds, in which Trump fights against the deep state and is committed to freeing America from its tentacled grip, while on the opposite side we have a corrupt and blackmailed candidate, an organic part of the deep state, who acts as a puppet in the hands of warmongers like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, of self-proclaimed “philanthropists” like the criminals George Soros and Klaus Schwab, or of characters like Jeffrey Epstein and Sean Combs. Their program is that of the Global Left, the World Economic Forum, the Rockefeller Foundation, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and ultimately the program of Vanguard, BlackRock, and StateStreet.

Their agenda is dictated by the financial oligarchy that controls humanity to the detriment of the people: an elite that operates not only in the United States but also in Canada, Australia, Europe, and wherever politics is held hostage by their investment funds and their pseudo-humanitarian organizations dedicated to the obliteration of Western Civilization. Behind these people – by now we should know this – are people devoted to evil, united by the satanic hatred against Our Lord Jesus Christ and those who believe in Him, mainly against the Catholic faithful. We want Christ to reign, and we proclaim it with pride: Christ is King! They want the Antichrist to reign, whose tyranny is made of chaos, war, disease, famine, and death. And the more emergencies and crises planned and created by the globalist elite increase, the more that elite has a pretext to impose new limitations, new restrictions of fundamental rights, and new social controls.

Joe Biden, the current “President,” is a servant of this subversive elite and widely blackmailable for the scandals and crimes committed by himself personally and also by his family, beginning with his son Hunter. His “Vice President,” Kamala Harris, is equally subservient to the same deep state. And the Democratic Party, to which they both belong, is the expression of the woke ideology that plagues all the parties of the global Left. Candidate Donald J. Trump, while certainly taking some serious critical positions that a Catholic cannot agree with, represents for us, dear American faithful, in this specific historical moment, the only possible choice to counter the globalist coup that the woke Left is about to implement definitively, irreparably, and with incalculable damage for future generations. Voting for Donald Trump means firmly distancing ourselves from an anti-Catholic, anti-Christian and anti-human vision of society. It means stopping those who want to create a hellish dystopia that is even worse than the one announced by George Orwell. And it also means – do not forget – giving him our vote of confidence, so that President Trump knows that the massive vote of Catholics and Christians that brought him back to the White House must become the premise for a more incisive commitment to the defense of life from conception to natural death, the traditional family, the right of parents to educate their children, and to the defense of the Christian Faith and the cultural identity of the Nation.

I repeat: the choice is between a conservative President, who is paying with his very life for his fight against the deep state, and an infernal monster who obeys Satan. For a Catholic, there can be no question: voting for Kamala Harris is morally inadmissible and constitutes a very grave sin. Nor is it morally possible to abstain, because in this war declaring oneself neutral means allying oneself with the enemy. People around the world are beginning to understand the threat that looms over them and their children’s future, and you Americans have understood it too. But even if this time it will be more difficult for the deep state to repeat the fraud of 2020, you must not think that it will resign itself to defeat so easily. Let us therefore prepare to prevent possible attacks and civil war scenarios from being used to impose martial law and new restrictions, after the attempts on his life from which President Trump providentially escaped.

But let us not forget, dear Faithful, that human energies alone are powerless in the face of this infernal display of forces. We proclaim that Christ is King – this means that Our Lord must return to reign, and the first way to make Him reign is by obeying His holy Law and living in His Grace. Let Christ reign in your hearts, in your families, in your communities, and throughout the entire United States of America: this is the only way to peace, harmony, and prosperity for your Nation. Think of how many of you Catholics there are in the United States! Vote without hesitation, and pray that Our Lord will enlighten American citizens in making their choice and grant victory to those who, at least, have no problem proclaiming that Christ is Lord. May God bless you all, and may the Virgin of Guadalupe, she who is the Patroness of the United States and all the Americas, and Saint Michael the Archangel, protect you. + Carlo Maria Viganò, Archbishop, Former Apostolic Nuncio to the United States of America   Archbishop Carlo Maria Viganò issued an open letter to American Catholics, voicing strong criticisms of Vice President Kamala Harris and her political positions.
Viganò warned American Catholics about what he perceives as Harris’s alignment with policies that contradict traditional Catholic values, particularly on issues like abortion and family.
The letter encourages Catholics to stay vigilant and to be discerning in their political support, emphasizing the importance of faith-based values in public life.
Viganò also addressed broader concerns about secularism in the U.S., suggesting that it poses a threat to religious freedoms.
The Archbishop’s message has resonated with some Catholic communities, while others view his statements as unusually direct for a religious leader.","Fri Oct 25 17:02:19 +0000 2024"

2. $25,000 tax credit to help homebuyers with their down payments
3. $50,000 for new small businesses startup tax deduction 
4. Build 3 million rental units to combat the housing crisis.

Ok ,so it's us against Trump again.
We are more than enough and too much for the media corporations which have cowered away from their obligation to Illuminate. 
My assumption is the Washington Post spent days running the bottom line dollars and selected lucrative over brave.
We ,the sovereign,will count on our future freedom and not on the future of our investors yearly reports.

Washington Post declines to endorse presidential candidate for first time in 36 years

The Washington Post will not be endorsing a presidential candidate in the 2024 election or in any election moving forward, publisher William Lewis announced Friday.

The shocking move breaks a 36-year tradition of endorsing mostly Democratic candidates for president. Lewis said the move will reestablish the Post as an ""independent"" newspaper and allow readers to make up their own minds about the election. 

""We are returning to our roots of not endorsing presidential candidates,"" Lewis wrote in an op-ed titled, ""On political endorsement.""","Fri Oct 25 16:46:00 +0000 2024"

Today, AV24 announces its $2,500,000 campaign which includes mobilizing a significant ground presence of Kennedy supporters in conjunction with a billboard truck campaign rolling across key counties in Pennsylvania from today through the election on November 5th. Focus areas outside of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh include Bucks County, Bethlehem, Luzerne, and Eerie. Additionally, AV24 will have a presence at all major sporting events including the Steelers vs NY Giants game.

Pennsylvania, long recognized as a pivotal swing state, could very well decide the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. With its significant allocation of electoral votes, Pennsylvania remains one of the most coveted prizes for any candidate. Swing states like Pennsylvania are expected to determine the victor, and as the race tightens, polls show these contests are in a statistical dead heat. As Trump continues to gain momentum, all eyes are on Pennsylvania, where a narrow margin could tip the scale and ultimately shape the future of the nation.

In a concerted effort to appeal to female voters, the billboard truck campaign features multiple messages: one highlights chronic disease in children, while the second showcases Trump and Kennedy; encouraging Kennedy supporters to join the former Presidential candidate in voting for Trump.

Another truck features four of the many strong women who support Kennedy and Trump (Nicole Shanahan, Kennedy's former running mate; Tulsi Gabbard, former Presidential candidate; Dr. Casey Means; and independent journalist Jessica Reed Kraus).

""Our strategy is to show women they are part of a powerful collective—millions strong—who will stand together on Election Day to vote for Trump and the team of MAHA women backing him. Party lines aside, women are the key to securing our children's future and driving lasting change,"" said Candace McDonald, CEO of AV24.

Women consistently vote at higher rates than men, and in Pennsylvania—where elections are decided by razor thin margins—their turnout could be the deciding factor in the 2024 presidential race. Through the ""Make America Healthy Again"" platform, we are appealing to  women, particularly in key suburban areas of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. These areas will be critical in determining the state's outcome, so it's crucial that we reach them before the November 5th election. Their voices and votes could ultimately shape the direction of the country.

In partnership with Mighty American Strikeforce, (MASF) who has been mobilizing people in swing states for two decades, AV24 is supporting an effort to get hundreds of volunteers in Pennsylvania to get out the vote for Donald Trump. In the past two weeks dozens of supporters have volunteered their time to canvas neighborhoods in support of this effort. Many hundreds more are expected to join the movement. MASF was credited as playing a pivotal role in Trump's 2016 victory in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

""The ""MAHA"" effect has been immediate in Pennsylvania. Both Kennedy supporters and die-hard MAGA supporters proudly wear MAHA gear as they canvass for Trump. Canvassers sport Trump, MAGA, MAHA and MASF gear creating a synergy fueling excitement and energy on the ground in Pennsylvania,"" said Michael Kane, AV24's Grassroots Manager.

Earlier this month, AV24 released the findings of a Zogby poll which found Kennedy supporters in swing states, like Pennsylvania, will determine the 2024 election outcome. The findings revealed that 56% of Kennedy supporters shifted to President Trump upon RFK's campaign suspension. This represents a 22% margin of victory for Trump among this cohort compared to the second-nearest candidate, Vice President Harris. 35% of Kennedy supporters that are still undecided are open to changing their vote to Trump by election day. AV24's efforts to mobilize Kennedy supporters in Pennsylvania play a vital role in helping Trump win this key state.","Fri Oct 25 16:21:25 +0000 2024"

They were standing down, trusting the plan, waiting for the white hats to win. They explained Trumps epic failures as Trump playing ever increasing dimensions of chess--as Trump praised Fauci and the vaccines.

Trump was a Pied Piper who took all anti-establishment types down with him.

Qanons went from shouting ""Winning!"" and being highly motivated to being highly demoralized.

Q helped to neutralize the resistance, and then to demoralize the resistance.

Trump made Biden's vaccine mandate possible. Only Omicron and the Freedom Convoy saved us while Trump praised the vaccines. Trump still wants credit for the vaccines and ventilators, which killed a lot more Americans than they saved.

Qanons believe Epstein is really dead and that Ghislaine Maxwell is really in jail. Nor do they understand that the minor hits to trafficking were used to flip the pedo narrative 180 degrees under Trump. The term pedo evoked real homosexual elites who were into very young boys, but under Trump it flipped to evoke imaginary friends, family, neighbors, and coworkers who were putatively into teenage girls. Before Trump, it was understood that the establishment protected pedos, but under Trump, the people believed the establishment was cracking down on pedos.

Trump didn't drain the swamp. Trump hired the swamp.

Trump owes everything he has to Zionists. Trump is Israel's little bitch.

Trump made no serious effort to prevent, stop, or rectify the stolen 2020 election. He finally asked the people to do something on January 6th, 2021, when it was much too late.

The 2024 US Presidential Election is now less than two weeks away! According to the latest CNBC All-America Economic Survey, former President Donald Trump leads Vice President Kamala Harris by 48%-46%. 

The survey, conducted from 15-19 October, included 1,000 voters nationwide, with 186 from key battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. An additional 400 voters from these states bring the battleground sample to 586.

Trump holds a commanding lead among voters prioritising inflation, the economy, and middle-class needs, while Harris leads on several secondary issues of concern, though they rank below the economy.
Both candidates are vying for the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Each likely has strongholds that could secure around 200 votes, but the race remains tight and competitive.
Early voting has begun, but remember: polls can shift as Election Day on 5 November approaches.","Fri Oct 25 15:44:18 +0000 2024"

While the president proposes budgets and can influence fiscal policy, it is ultimately Congress that drafts, debates, and passes spending legislation. During Trump's presidency, both Republican and Democratic members of Congress supported various spending initiatives that led to the increase in national debt.
Amazingly, 76 members of the House have all voted for every piece of legislation that spends money and has been signed into law by President Trump. And perhaps most amazingly, 69 of those 76 are Democrats!
Therefore, the responsibility for these fiscal decisions lies with the legislative branch as a whole, reflecting the complex interplay between executive proposals and legislative approval.","Fri Oct 25 20:53:15 +0000 2024"

In a jaw-dropping twist, the Los Angeles Times has decided not to endorse a candidate for the 2024 presidential election. This is huge, especially since the paper has backed Democratic candidates consistently for over a decade. 
We as American Citizens must also set aside long standing political party affiliations and Vote for President Trump to Save America from complete destruction! Kamala Harris & Joe Biden spending over $700 million dollars in the past 3 plus years on a NO BID contract to transport illegal unaccompanied children in the night & they can’t tell America where these children are is only one of many reasons we must Vote this Cancer out of our government! Over 300 thousand children are missing & no explanation has been given. When investigative Journalists have tried to do their job questioning the whereabouts of these children, they are met with a brick wall of silence. Whistle blowers are coming forward who were employed in this operation and report you can’t unsee what they have witnessed! I Voted for President Trump because I want these children found & those complicit including the parents of these children to be held accountable for trafficking children! We can’t ignore this tragedy anymore! The mental scars on these children has to be huge! And we wonder how they become menaces to society! The Democrats have a real problem with valuing Human Life!

By Louis JacobsonSeptember 30, 2024
By Ian McKinneySeptember 30, 2024Updated with additional promises, Oct. 13, 2024.Former President Donald Trump’s policy agenda for a potential second term resurrects some familiar proposals from his first, but it would go further on many fronts. It would, for example, include a more aggressive deportation policy, greatly expand tariffs and roll back transgender rights.Since PolitiFact’s founding in 2007, a cornerstone of coverage has been tracking the progress, or lack thereof, of the sitting president’s campaign promises. We tracked 533 promises former President Barack Obama made during his 2008 and 2012 campaigns, broken down into one of three final ratings: Promise Kept, Promise Broken, and Compromise.When Trump won in 2016, we tracked 102 of his promises. And we are now tracking the progress on 99 promises made by President Joe Biden during his 2020 campaign.Trump has articulated more than 100 policy proposals since announcing his reelection bid in late 2022. To make our list, Trump himself had to make a promise in speeches, interviews, rallies, or on social media; we did not include proposals backed only by outside groups, such as Project https://t.co/PMuqbDtRWt, we list more than 100 promises Trump has made for a second term. We compiled promises made by his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, in a separate article.Did we miss a promise? Email your suggestion to truthometer@politifact.com.RELATED: Here’s what Kamala Harris is promising voters📷A vehicle drives along the U.S. side of the U.S.-Mexico border wall in Nogales, Ariz. (AP)ImmigrationCarry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American historyDuring his presidency, Trump promised to — but didn’t — deport all immigrants living in the country illegally. Immigration experts have told PolitiFact that mass deportation efforts would likely fail because of concerns over cost and constitutionality.Trump hasn’t provided detailed plans for mass deportations or explained where the financial resources required would come from if Congress did not substantially increase appropriations. He has said he would begin by deporting criminals, and use local law enforcement and the National Guard to help. In April, he told Time magazine that building mass deportation camps and using the U.S. military was not out of the https://t.co/dvz6DHKyC5 a border wallDuring his presidency, Trump built around 450 miles of border barriers along the southern U.S. border, many of which replaced old, dilapidated barriers. Achieving his redoubled promise would require cooperation from Congress, which would need to bless the funding. During his presidency, Trump received some funding from Congress and declared a national emergency that allowed him to redirect Defense Department funding.But large portions of the U.S. southern border are on privately owned or federally protected land, so barriers can’t be placed there unless the federal government buys the land or seizes it through eminent domain.End birthright citizenshipTrump failed during his presidency to fulfill his promise to end people’s right to become U.S citizens if they’re born in the U.S., regardless of their parents’ immigration status. Legal experts told us that attempts to end birthright citizenship would prompt a court battle and could require a constitutional amendment.Restore and expand the travel banDuring his presidency, Trump carried out executive orders to ban citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S. for 90 days. He faced numerous legal challenges. The travel ban’s third and final version restricted U.S. entry to people from the seven countries, plus Chad, North Korea and Venezuela. In June 2018, the Supreme Court upheld this travel ban. On his first day in office, Biden ended the executive order.Shift parts of federal law enforcement to assist with immigration enforcementTrump and other presidents, including Biden, have sent troops to border states to support Border Patrol agents amid increased migration. Troops at the border transport these agents, drive and repair surveillance vehicles and clean brush. Under current law, they do not engage with migrants or enforce laws.Suspend refugee resettlementDuring his presidency, Trump paused the refugee resettlement program for 120 days. He considered lowering the cap to zero but instead reduced the cap each year from former President Barack Obama’s limit of 110,000 in fiscal year 2017 to a record low of 15,000 in fiscal year 2021. This time he's proposing suspending it entirely.Refugees, as defined by U.S. law, are people outside of the U.S. who fled their home countries because of persecution related to race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a particular social group. They have received refugee protections from the U.S. before they enter the country. Asylum seekers also must meet the refugee definition, but they have to be physically in the U.S. to seek protections. Biden lifted the cap to 125,000 for fiscal years 2022 and 2023.Terminate the Customs and Border Protection’s CBP One appTrump wants to end a mobile phone application that migrants use to access Customs and Border Protection services — even though his administration launched the tool in 2020. The Biden administration has expanded its use, allowing immigrants to make appointments at official ports of entry to begin the asylum-seeking process.""Revoke the student visas of radical anti-American and antisemitic foreigners at colleges and universities.""Trump hasn’t said what the ideological screening would entail. Federal officials already check applicants’ backgrounds, including monitoring social media. But the focus on antisemitism is new, particularly since the emergence of protests after Hamas attacked Israel Oct. 7, 2023, and Israel responded militarily. Expanded backgrounding could introduce privacy concerns and discourage visa applications, PolitiFact has reported.Give college graduates, including those from junior colleges, a green card to be able to stay legally in the U.S.Changes in eligibility for permanent resident status, also known as receiving a green card, would require congressional action. Congress has not passed reforms to the immigration system in decades.Terminate work permits for immigrants in the U.S. illegallyDuring his presidency, Trump tried to end a program that protects certain people who crossed the border illegally as children from deportation and gives them work permits. The Supreme Court ruled against him ending the program, but its legality is unsettled; the case is expected to again reach the Supreme Court.Make it illegal to distribute welfare benefits to immigrants in the U.S. illegallyIt’s unclear what effect this would have: Most immigrants living illegally in the country are  ineligible for benefits from federal programs. A valid Social Security number is needed to receive most federal benefits. Immigrants in the country illegally are not issued Social Security numbers. Trump has separately pledged to make immigrants in the U.S. ineligible for public housing assistance. Noncitizen eligibility for housing programs now vary by program.Invoke the Alien Enemies Act to deport gang membersThis 1798 law was created when the U.S. feared an impending war with France. It allows the president to arrest, detain and deport people without due process under certain circumstances. But legal experts said Trump would likely face legal obstacles if he tried to use it for this purpose.Designate drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizationsAs president in 2019, Trump said he would designate Mexican drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations. The legal designation is used to identify foreign groups that ""engage in premeditated, politically motivated acts of terrorism against noncombatant targets,"" according to the Wilson Center. However, Trump said he would temporarily hold off on the designation at the request of Mexico’s president. Now that Trump is campaigning again, the promise is back. Some international relations and counterterrorism experts have questioned what tangible impact giving drug cartels the designation would have, adding that it could harm U.S. diplomatic relations with Mexico.Revoke the Temporary Protected Status of Haitians in Springfield, OhioTrump and his running mate, JD Vance, have targeted Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, including the accusation that they are eating their neighbors’ pets, which we have rated Pants on Fire. In an interview, Trump said he would revoke their legal status and ""bring them back to their country."" That would involve ending their Temporary Protected Status, which protects them from deportation because they are from a country experiencing war, environmental disasters and epidemics.EconomyAdd a tariff of 10% to 20% to all nondomestic goods sold in AmericaAdd a 60% tariff on goods from ChinaInstitute a reciprocal tariff policyCollectively, these three promises would continue Trump’s efforts, dating to his presidency, to raise tariffs on foreign goods, especially when foreign countries impose tariffs on the U.S. These foreign nation tariffs would be the target of Trump’s reciprocal tariff policy. Independent groups have estimated that Trump’s proposed tariffs would cost a typical family between $2,000 and $4,000 a year and some Senate Republicans have expressed skepticism about the plan.Ban U.S. companies from investing in Chinese companies, and ban Chinese companies from investing in U.S. companiesAdopt a four-year plan to phase out Chinese importsThis pair of promises would expand on policies Trump sought to impose on China during his presidency. The aim would be to counter China’s influence in the international economy and erase advantages China has over U.S. companies.Provide a ""middle class, upper class, lower class, business class, big tax cut.""Trump has not detailed how his new tax cut would work. The tax bill Trump signed in 2017 did lower taxes for all income groups, at least initially, but wealthier taxpayers gained disproportionately.End taxation on Social SecurityTrump wrote on Truth Social, ""Seniors should not pay tax on Social Security."" He did not provide details, such as offsetting revenues to pay for it. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that doing this would cost $1.6 trillion to $1.8 trillion over a decade.End taxation on tipsThis would end taxation on the tipped portions of workers. An analysis by Ernie Tedeschi at the Yale Budget Lab found that 2.5% of workers are in tipped jobs, including 5% of workers in the bottom quarter of earners. Trump was the first to propose this; his 2024 presidential race opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, followed suit, although economists have mixed feelings about whether the benefits to workers would outstrip the cost to the government, and about whether companies would take advantage of the new policy to force more workers into tipped jobs.End taxation on overtimeBesides ending taxation on Social Security and tips, Trump said he would end taxation on pay for overtime work. The Tax Foundation, a center-right think tank, estimated that this would cost anywhere from $227 billion to $1.1 trillion over 10 years, depending on how the new policy was structured.Reduce taxation for Americans living overseasSome Americans living abroad pay taxes to both the U.S. and a foreign country, although they can deduct the taxes they paid to the foreign government. Critics suggest that this could incentivize higher-income Americans to move to lower-tax countries overseas and escape U.S. tax liability.Reduce the corporate tax rate from 21% to 15% ""for companies that make their products in America""Trump’s 2017 tax law previously cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Harris has proposed raising it to 28%.Put a temporary cap on credit card interest ratesTrump said ""we're going to cap"" credit card interest rates ""at around 10%. We can't let them make 25% and 30%."" When he made the pledge in September 2024, the typical interest rate for credit card accounts that are assessed interest was 22.8%. The typical rate has never been as low as 10%, going back to at least 1994, when researchers began collecting the data on credit card interest rates. Rates briefly went as low as 12% in 2003. Skeptics say banks might counter by tightening standards for who can have cards.Cut car insurance rates by 50%It’s unclear how Trump could lower car insurance rates by this much.Make interest on car loans tax deductibleTrump revealed this proposal in a speech to the Detroit Economic Club, pitching it as a way to boost the automobile industry.Make it tax deductible to purchase a home generatorTrump made this promise after Hurricane Helene and Hurricane Milton struck. Trump proposed that it was retroactive to Sept. 1, 2024 and valid through Aug. 31, 2025.Restore the state and local tax deduction (SALT)Trump’s 2017 tax law capped  the amount taxpayers can deduct state and local tax payments on their federal tax returns at $10,000. This irritated affluent suburbanites in blue states, where state and local taxes tend to be high. Trump promised to reverse his action on the deduction in a Truth Social before a rally on New York’s Long Island, which is home to many such taxpayers. Trump wrote that he would ""get SALT back."" The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated that this could cost the federal government $1.2 trillion over 10 years.Stop China from buying land in the U.S.Chinese investors, entities and U.S. corporations with Chinese shareholders collectively owned 383,935 acres of agricultural and nonagricultural land in the United States, as of 2021. It is unclear how many of these acres the Chinese Communist Party controls. An expert told PolitiFact that although the Chinese Communist Party could influence or coerce Chinese people or entities to use farmlands for spying or other purposes, there hasn’t been evidence of such activity.Create ""freedom cities""Trump would hold a ""national contest to charter up to 10 new cities on a very small portion of federal land and award these charters to the best ideas and proposals for development."" Trump billed this contest to boost U.S. industry and build fast-growing cities from scratch. The plan aims to ""reopen the frontier, reignite American imagination, and give hundreds of thousands of young people and other people, all hardworking families, a new shot at home ownership and in fact, the American Dream."" He said the land would not infringe on national parks or other ""natural treasures.""Create ""baby bonuses"" for young parentsTrump didn’t specify how his idea would work, but Democrats have previously supported ""baby bonus"" proposals, so this could be an area for bipartisan cooperation.Oppose corporate bailoutsTrump has focused his opposition to government bailouts to those for banks, such as Silicon Valley Bank, which collapsed during Biden’s presidency.📷Emergency workers clear rubble Sept. 29, 2024, after a Russian attack in Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. (Ukrainian Emergency Service via AP)Foreign policy and militaryEnd the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hoursTrump has been less supportive than the Biden-Harris administration in backing Ukraine against Russia, which launched an invasion in 2022. Trump has not detailed his plan, but even Russian officials have expressed skepticism that this could be https://t.co/hMNWGaSP9n Chinese ownership of U.S. vital infrastructureHold China financially responsible for the COVID-19 pandemicPartner with businesses and universities to help them protect against Chinese surveillance and cyber-attacksThese three promises collectively target China as a national security threat, not just an economic rival. Depending on the details, the goal of toughening the U.S. stance against China might be able to secure bipartisan buy-in.Construct an Iron Dome-like missile defense system for the U.S.The U.S. has been a leader in creating the anti-missile technology known as Iron Dome that has protected Israel from airborne attack. But experts say the threats to Israel are different than those facing the United States, making Iron Dome a less obvious solution for the U.S.Provide record-breaking military fundingAlthough Trump has touted that he did not launch a war on his watch, this promise expresses support for generous military funding.Withdraw from the World Health OrganizationTrump has criticized the WHO, including for its perceived closeness to China, which he’s said compromised its advice on the coronavirus and its investigations of the pandemic, which emerged in https://t.co/0dJsH2IxsL and human servicesLeave Social Security and Medicare unchangedKeep the Social Security retirement age unchangedTrump, during his business and political career, has sometimes said he’d be open to cutting Social Security or Medicare. As president, he proposed budgets that would have cut Social Security’s disability programs (but not retirement benefits) and Medicare (but in ways that experts say would have increased efficiency, not harmed beneficiaries). During the 2024 campaign, Trump has been consistent in his written platforms and in public remarks that he will not cut either program. However, Social Security is at risk of running out of money by the 2030s, which would trigger significant across-the-board cuts.Either have the government pay for or require insurers to pay for in vitro fertilization treatmentAmid attacks from Democrats that certain anti-abortion laws could also harm reproductive technologies, Trump proposed having the government cover in vitro fertilization costs or requiring insurers to do so. The idea is not universally popular among Republicans,  partly because of IVF’s expense, which often runs between $15,000 to $30,000 per IVF cycle.Create a presidential task force to investigate the rise in chronic health problems, including autism, autoimmune disorders and obesityGreater attention to some of these health and wellness topics might win broad support. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who endorsed Trump after suspending his independent presidential campaign, has repeated the debunked claim that vaccines cause autism and other health problems, and medical professionals would oppose an administration role for him or his allies.Ban urban camping and arrest violatorsCreate ""tent cities"" where the homeless can be movedThe Supreme Court issued a ruling in 2024 that empowers jurisdictions to remove homeless people. Trump’s proposals could push their powers even further.End veteran homelessnessVeteran homelessness is a persistent challenge; Obama had two promises on this topic and earned a Promise Kept on both, but neither one was as sweeping as ending veteran homelessness entirely, as Trump has pledged. A Veterans Affairs Department census in January 2023 found more than 35,000 veterans experiencing homelessness, up 7.4% compared to 2022 but down by more than half since 2010.📷Mannika Hopkins talks with her fourth graders Aug. 14, 2024, on the first day of school at Greenville Elementary in Greenville, Fla. (AP)EducationAbolish the Education DepartmentTrump is following the lead of a generation of conservative activists who have called for abolishing the Education Department. At its most extreme, this could end up eliminating federal K-12 funding, which, separating out a pandemic-era bump, typically accounts for about 10% of K-12 budgets nationally, with significant variation by jurisdiction. However, he has not been specific about his vision, and it’s not clear whether Congress would sign off on such a proposal.Spend more per pupil on education than any other country in the worldThis promise might conflict with the one to eliminate the Education Department; it’s not clear whether this money would come from federal coffers or be some kind of federal mandate on states or localities.Provide universal school choiceProvide $10,000 per child tax-free to homeschoolersMake sure homeschoolers can access the same experiences that in-school students haveMake school principals a directly elected positionCreate a new credentialing body for teachersAbolish teacher tenure for grades K-12Trump and other Republicans have criticized teachers’ unions, which play a significant role in public school systems. These sorts of promises would give advantages to other types of education, including private schools and homeschooling, while also undercutting traditional public schools and teachers’ unions.Won’t give federal dollars to schools that have a vaccine mandateIt’s unclear whether Trump means to pull federal funding for schools that require the COVID-19 vaccine (which isn’t a standard K-12 requirement) or those that require long-standing courses of vaccination for diseases such as polio (which are nearly universal, although many states offer exemptions). The latter, if it is the goal, would hurt public health significantly, experts say.Enable prayer and other religious activities in public schoolsTrump receives strong backing from conservative Christians, who have spent decades advocating for prayer in schools since the Supreme Court limited it in 1962. As president, Trump promoted the issue.Order the Justice Department to open investigations into any school that participates in race-based discriminationThis is part of conservatives’ battle against diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives.Stop funding colleges that engage in ""censorship""This promise aligns with conservatives who see colleges as hostile to right-of-center views. ""Colleges have gotten hundreds of billions from hardworking taxpayers, and now we are going to get this anti-American insanity out of our institutions once and for all,"" Trump said, adding that the fight to remove ""radical left"" bias could involve the agencies that accredit higher education institutions.Offer more low-cost postsecondary degree optionsIncrease funding for schools with job and career counselorsThese proposals have the potential to secure bipartisan support. Biden has pledged to make two years of community college or a high-quality training program tuition-free, a promise we rate Stalled.Create a competition for high school athletes called ""the patriot games""Crime and gunsFully pardon people convicted of crimes related to the storming the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021Trump has been vague about who would qualify for pardons, but he’s been clear about his sympathy for people convicted of crimes and sentenced to prison after storming the U.S. Capitol on his behalf on Jan. 6, 2021, aiming to overturn the 2020 election. Presidents have broad powers to pardon and commute sentences.Appoint a special prosecutor to ""go after"" Joe Biden and his familyIt’s unclear whether Biden, who ended his reelection bid a month after Trump made this promise, would remain a target if Trump were to win back the White House. If Trump is elected, he could appoint a special https://t.co/3hwwmKHU3Y the death penalty for child rapists and child traffickersImpose the death penalty for selling drugsEncourage stop-and-frisk policingIncrease punishments for juvenile offendersIncreasing the use of the death penalty and encouraging stop-and-frisk policing, which some have said rely on racial profiling, are two elements of Trump’s tough-on-crime agenda.Increase liability protections for police officersInvest record amounts in American policePart of Trump’s approach to crime has been to bolster rights for police officers, who he says are hobbled by lawsuits and second-guessing.Expand concealed carry rightsOverturn Biden policies affecting gun owners and manufacturersWith one exception — banning bump stocks, which the Supreme Court later invalidated — Trump has reliably supported Second Amendment rights. These policies would continue that approach.Investigate federal arrests of conservatives and ChristiansThis is something some Christians and conservatives have argued for, but Trump hasn’t said how he’d do this. The focus singles out Christians when anti-Jewish and anti-Islamic hate crimes are higher, federal data shows.Commute the sentence of ""Silk Road"" website operator Ross UlbrichtTrump made this promise to the Libertarian Party when he was seeking the party’s endorsement. Ulbricht has been in prison since 2013. He was sentenced to two life terms plus 40 years on convictions that included responsibility for six deaths that resulted from drugs sold on his website.ElectionsRequire proof of citizenship at the pollsRequire voter ID at the pollsRequire only paper ballotsCount all votes on election nightTrump’s promises about elections are all linked to his years of false claims about voting by mail and voter fraud.

Mel Gibson has made it clear he will be voting for Donald Trump in the upcoming 2024 presidential election.  He was spotted at LAX and offered a brief response to questions about his choice, stating that ""Trump is a pretty good guess"" while expressing his opinion on Kamala Harris's intelligence. According to TMZ, Gibson also suggested that allowing Harris into the White House would be detrimental for the nation, referencing her alleged low IQ and lack of policy proposals.  This marks another instance where Gibson has openly expressed his political views, although he maintains a distinct history with social issues and controversies. 

Gibson's public statements regarding his voting choices reveal continued involvement in current events, even though his past controversial remarks regarding the Jewish community are not forgotten. He previously faced backlash for antisemitic comments during an arrest in 2006, but has since issued apologies and emphasized that these past actions were fueled by personal struggle with alcohol abuse, not a prejudiced intention towards any group of people. In recent years, Gibson's political views have been more vocal, with notable examples like his support for Donald Trump in the UFC 264 crowd alongside bodyguards.  

However, Gibson’s history is marred by incidents of public antisemitism that sparked considerable criticism. Notably, he was accused of making antisemitic remarks during a DUI arrest in 2006 and later faced backlash for a controversial movie, The Passion of the Christ, in 2004. Despite facing condemnation from numerous Jewish organizations, Gibson has continued to be critical of political establishments and expressed disdain for both major political parties, often taking public stances against their agendas.
