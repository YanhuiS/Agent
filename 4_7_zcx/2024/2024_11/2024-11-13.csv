As originally devised by the framers, Senators were appointed by the state legislatures. Their six-year terms were staggered so that at most only one-third of the Senate could turn over during any two-year period. On the other hand, all representatives in the House were elected by the people every two years.

The House was the body that was supposed to be responsive to changes in popular movements. The Senate was intended to provide a brake against such waves, preventing populist movements from gaining traction too quickly.

You may not like the U.S. Senate standing in the way of voter preferences, but that's exactly what the framers intended. The real problem is that almost everything else our current government does is the opposite of what the framers intended. Protecting that status quo now entrenches the very type of government the Founders wrote the Constitution to prevent.","Wed Nov 13 20:46:25 +0000 2024"

It is not Trump who is destroying Europe. We are doing it ourselves with the wrong policy in our countries, picking multiculturalism over citizenship and shared values as we demonstrated in Amsterdam. We must respect the people in the United States and their democratic process, even when we don’t like the outcome. 

Why do we forget so many simple facts? - That most people just want to be able to pay their bills, walk safely on the street, and have their welfare protected? That this aspiration is the same whether you're black or white. And that's where the Left and part of the press have completely missed the point. 

By treating the legitimate concerns of citizens as a detail. Perhaps it is time to wake up and be honest about EU-US relations.

——

We moeten onze mentaliteit in Europa veranderen en ophouden de Amerikaanse kiezer als zondebok te gebruiken. Het is niet Trump die Europa kapot maakt. We doen het zelf met het verkeerde beleid in onze landen, waarbij we multiculturalisme verkiezen boven burgerschap en gedeelde waarden, zoals we in Amsterdam hebben laten zien. We moeten de mensen in de Verenigde Staten en hun democratische proces respecteren, zelfs als de uitkomst ons niet bevalt. 

Waarom vergeten we zoveel simpele feiten? Dat de meeste mensen gewoon hun rekeningen willen kunnen betalen, veilig over straat kunnen lopen en hun welvaart beschermd zien? Dat dit streven hetzelfde is, of je nu zwart of blank bent. En dat is waar links en een deel van de pers de plank volledig misslaan. 

Door de legitieme zorgen van burgers als een detail te beschouwen. Misschien is het tijd om wakker te worden en eerlijk te zijn over de betrekkingen tussen de EU en de VS.

What's next for DeSantis then? Multiples options are on the table:

1. Serve out remainder of gubernatorial term until 2026 with a focus on policy achievements and helping Trump admin. Announce early for the 2028 GOP Primary. Get a head start on other candidates in fundraising and organizing.

2. Serve out remaining term until 2026 and run for the open FL Senate seat if Rubio is out. Gives him a role in government as he approaches 2028 which helps maintain visibility and relevancy.

3. Appoint himself to the FL Senate seat now (or have Lt. Gov. Nunez do it) and win the 2026 election for that seat. This puts him in DC in the middle of the action for the Trump presidency.

4. Serve out remaining term and then segue into a talk show spot at Fox News. This could help him begin building a bond with GOP primary voters + repair relationship w/voters who might be upset at him for running in 2024.

How do you think @RonDeSantis should approach the path forward?

BUT here are 14 clues on who he might be talking about 👇

1. Stephen Miller is Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy. His org, AFL, helped win the Harvard affirmative action lawsuit.

2. You may also remember Miller’s AFL sued to shut down a grant for Black women entrepreneurs in Atlanta.

3. AFL sued Progressive Insurance for a grant program supporting Black entrepreneurs.

4. Black Farmers won a lawsuit but then AFL challenged and blocked the Farm Loan Forgiveness Program meant to restore them, on behalf of White farmers.

5. AFL sued NYU over admissions practices that boosted diversity “at the expense of White and Asian men.”

6. AFL sued Northwestern Law School for recruiting “non-white and non-male faculty.”

7. AFL sued CBS for hiring policies prioritizing “nonwhite, LGBTQ, or female” candidates.

8. AFL sued Northface after a sponsored client accused Jonathan Talbot of “racism and white privilege.”

9. AFL sued Expedia on behalf of a candidate who claimed, “As a white man, he was not ‘diverse’ enough.”

10. AFL sued Ally Financial, claiming it discriminated against “a white male.”

11. AFL sued Red Hat Inc., stating, “AFL’s client, a white male…”

12. AFL also sued CBS on behalf of a “white, heterosexual male script coordinator.”

13. AFL sued Meta, stating, “Because Mr. Harker is white, he was not eligible to participate in the DTL Program.”

14. AFL sued Amazon over a diversity bonus, claiming “whites are categorically ineligible.”

So no, Trump didn’t say “reparations for White people”—because he didn’t have to.

It adds to domestic inflation - and keeps Australian interest rates higher.

It makes Australian assets more vulnerable to foreign raiders.

The FBI seized Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan’s phone and electronics at his Soho home early Wednesday, just a week after Polymarket accurately predicted Trump’s election win. 

Sources close to Coplan call it “political retribution,” alleging the raid is aimed at punishing Polymarket for outperforming traditional polls. 

The government reportedly suspects market manipulation favoring Trump. 

Polymarket, a transparent prediction market charging no fees, denies any wrongdoing. 

Coplan was not arrested.

Where's Roy Cooper?? 

FEMA has been reported to have been involved in an incident where a supervisor instructed relief workers to skip homes with signs supporting Donald Trump during disaster relief efforts following Hurricane Milton in Florida. This has been confirmed through multiple news outlets, including The Daily Wire, which first reported the story, and subsequent confirmations by FEMA's administrator, Deanne Criswell, who called the actions ""reprehensible"" and confirmed the termination of the employee involved. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis also announced an investigation into what he described as ""targeted discrimination"" against Trump supporters. These reports indicate that this was not just an isolated incident by a rogue employee but part of broader instructions given during the relief effort, though specifics on how widespread this practice was remain unclear. This situation has sparked significant discussion and criticism regarding political bias within federal agencies.","Wed Nov 13 08:52:00 +0000 2024"

A FEMA worker, Marn'i Washington, was fired for advising disaster relief teams to skip homes with Trump signs, claiming it was due to 'hostile' behavior. 

Washington insisted that FEMA's approach was about avoiding hostility, not political affiliation, and that avoidance was standard protocol in such cases.

Washington argued that her actions aligned with FEMA's core practice of 'avoidance first, then de-escalation,' and were not isolated to Florida. 

She mentioned similar instructions being given in the Carolinas. 

Congressional Republicans have vowed to investigate FEMA, calling the agency's practices politically motivated.

FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell condemned the directive as a violation of the agency's core principles and promised to prevent such incidents in the future.

I’m disheartened to see so many MAGA supporters saying that Trump’s Cabinet picks won’t be able to beat The Swamp.  This is particularly true with Trump’s latest pick of Pete Hegseth as SecDef.  Pete is a warrior who never saw the E Ring of the Pentagon, and some Trump supporters are saying the Military/Industrial Complex and the Pentagon Deep State will make mincemeat of him.  

I disagree.  

Pete represents disruptive change, just like Elon/Vivek in DOGE and the rest of the Trump ’47 team.  

Trump learned his lesson in his first term when he wrongfully trusted the Beltway insiders, and he has seen the error of his ways.  Even better than that, he has had four years to figure how to make things right. 

History is replete with examples of effective disruptive change.  Effective disruptive change is when a system is failing, and a dynamic visionary radically wrecks the old system and simultaneously builds it anew in a better way.

Moses.

Leonardo da Vinci.

Galileo.

Martin Luther.

Abraham Lincoln.

Louis Pasteur.

Henry Ford.

Thomas Edison.

General George C . Marshall.

Jackie Robinson.

Ronald Reagan.

Margaret Thatcher.

Pope John Paul II.

Steve Jobs.

Elon Musk.

Donald Trump.

Change agents, every last one of them.

When entrenched systems fail, change agent visionaries know that radical new ideas are needed to come in and wreck the old system while building an effective new system inside the ruins of the old one.

Donald Tump is such a visionary change agent, and he is picking kindred change agent spirits like Pete Hegseth to tear things down and build a better day anew.  Pete knows the rot that has infested the DoD, because he was on the receiving end of it as a dirty boots infantryman.  His books express the sort of radical reimagining of the DoD that is typical of all visionary change agents.

Will Pete Hegseth face intense bureaucratic resistance to the radical change that is so necessary to return our military to an effective warfighting force?  Of course he will.  Is his resume one that lacks experience in the entrenched Pentagon budget battles that everyone thinks are the defining characteristic of classic senior defense leadership?  Yes it does.

I don’t care.

Radical change is necessary, and radical leadership choices are required to make that happen.

It will be a hard slog, and there will be defeats on the way to victory.  But constructive radical change WILL happen, because I trust Donald Trump’s vision.

Let’s get behind that vision and make it work.","Wed Nov 13 03:08:14 +0000 2024"

Why would they allow him to win unless they were certain he would fulfill the ruling class agenda again?

I am also not holding my breath for any surprises from Trump, personally.

The important thing is that the Democratic Party has suffered a monumental defeat. That remains worth celebrating.

What comes next for the American state will have to pass through the fire of a new legitimation. And I frankly doubt they will pass it successfully.

So what can we expect? Chaos, disarray, turmoil.

Trump was never going to save anyone. MAGA already rreversibly changed American politics. The fight for MAGA ended when even the Democrats started copying it.

MAGA won. This is neither good or bad, it's just objective fact. It simply cemented it's foothold irreversibly.

There is no going back to ""normal democracy,"" (neoliberalism) based on the rule of expert consensus, human rights, and trust in institutions. 

Now what?

The struggle against the regime will take on a new form. MAGA has become superfluous and the time now is for the construction of a new Left-Wing.

All the losers of the past - DSA, etc. - they are as dead as Trump is politically.

Repeating the stupidities and mistakes of the past is a dead end.

American politics will not be about MAGA vs. Libtards anymore.

It will be defined by a post-liberal Left versus a post-liberal Right.

And the old 'liberal-left' is now destined to be absorbed into the Right.

In some sense, Qanon already proved that Trump was a political corpse. That he became a tool of the same deep state was interpreted as though he had a secret plan behind the scenes.

The key error is to fixate on Trump. In a way he is similar to Biden - a walking corpse. He should not be treated as a ""strongman"" or father figure to be resented.

He is not worth any special attention. We know from 4 years of presidential dementia that the U.S. President doesn't rule the regime.

The regime is an impersonal machine. It is an organ of oligarchical dictatorship.

This machine must be smashed. The Democratic Party was a vital part of that. The GOP, by contrast, has always been a messy circus. Frankly, who cares about Trump?

He has not proven he has any agency of his own. 

Trump's election is a symptom of the chaos, confusion and disarray within the regime.

People thought that Biden's election was a 'return to normal.' But this was a silly illusion. 

The regime is going to re-group and re-organize in a new form. Who knows what that will look like.

In the meantime, the Communist Party will be preparing.

The American constitution is a red line. As imperfect as it is, the ruling class cannot be permitted the liberty to dispose of it.

Be vigilant of deep state and DoD actors who may try to use the face of Trump for their own agenda, with a world war on the horizon.

The true civil society that can defend the popular sovereignty of the American people is not the CIA-backed NGOs and institutions.

It is the American working class alone.","Wed Nov 13 17:08:23 +0000 2024"

1. Stephen Miller is Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy. His org, AFL, helped win the Harvard affirmative action lawsuit.

2. You may also remember Miller’s AFL sued to shut down a grant for Black women entrepreneurs in Atlanta.

3. AFL sued Progressive Insurance for a grant program supporting Black entrepreneurs.

4. Black Farmers won a lawsuit but then AFL challenged and blocked the Farm Loan Forgiveness Program meant to restore them, on behalf of White farmers.

5. AFL sued NYU over admissions practices that boosted diversity “at the expense of White and Asian men.”

6. AFL sued Northwestern Law School for recruiting “non-white and non-male faculty.”

7. AFL sued CBS for hiring policies prioritizing “nonwhite, LGBTQ, or female” candidates.

8. AFL sued Northface after a sponsored client accused Jonathan Talbot of “racism and white privilege.”

9. AFL sued Expedia on behalf of a candidate who claimed, “As a white man, he was not ‘diverse’ enough.”

10. AFL sued Ally Financial, claiming it discriminated against “a white male.”

11. AFL sued Red Hat Inc., stating, “AFL’s client, a white male…”

12. AFL also sued CBS on behalf of a “white, heterosexual male script coordinator.”

13. AFL sued Meta, stating, “Because Mr. Harker is white, he was not eligible to participate in the DTL Program.”

14. AFL sued Amazon over a diversity bonus, claiming “whites are categorically ineligible.”

So no, Trump didn’t say “reparations for White people”—because he didn’t have to.

""Has Donald Trump quoted Hitler? Yes! Does he embody some of Hitler's ideas? Yes!"" the teacher said.

A California teacher has been placed on administrative leave after going on an rant over Donald Trump's landslide election victory during class last week. He reportedly told his students that they could be placed in ""concentration camps,"" disparaged Latinos and voters for supporting a ""rapist,"" and raved about the patriarchy, yelling, ""This sh*t is not a f*ck*ng game!""

The educator, who has not been publicly identified, teaches AP world history at Valley View High School in the Moreno Valley Unified School District. A spokesperson for the school told ABC 7 in a statement that the teacher has been placed on leave, explaining, ""We do not condone the behavior that occurred, and an immediate investigation has been launched.""

Video footage taken inside the classroom and posted on X shows the history teacher equating President-elect Donald Trump to Hitler, berating minority voters, and giving other profanity-laced screeds.

""Can you end up in a concentration camp in your lifetime? Yes! Can you end up with no human rights? Yes! Will it happen to you? Most likely not, which is a good thing. But has Donald Trump quoted Hitler? Yes! Does he embody some of Hitler's ideas? Yes!,"" the teacher told his class during the lecture. He went on to call Trump ""treasonous scum,"" and added that the soon-to-be 47th president is a ""rapist, draft dodging coward,"" according to the video footage.

The teacher expressed an exceptional amount of disdain toward male Latino voters, over half of whom supported Trump. ""I know a lot of Latino men on this campus that love Donald Trump and he has called their mothers rapist,"" he said, adding ""I know a lot of Latino men who wish they were white...God, they wanna be white so bad, but they never will be.""

Billionaire Trump backer Bill Ackman said on Twitter/X today that he is hearing from leaders across the business community who are overjoyed about Trump’s win in the 2024 election, including people who did not even vote for him.

Trump’s record on the economy and business is obviously one of the main reasons he won reelection. People want the Trump economy back.

A man at Ackman’s level knows all the major players. For him to be saying this is a big deal.

Here’s part of what he says in his post:

The business community is giddy with excitement about the @realDonaldTrump administration. I am hearing this from everyone, including from people who didn’t vote for Trump.

Business confidence is a self-fulfilling prophecy. Business leaders are becoming more confident about the country and the economy. This means they will be making more investments in our future which will drive the economy and the stock market, reducing the cost of capital and bolstering confidence further, catalyzing more investment and more growth in a self-reinforcing, virtuous cycle.

Merger and acquisition activity is about to explode as there are an enormous number of deals that have been deferred pending a more favorable regulatory environment for transactions. M&A will drive efficiency, greater profitability and growth. It will also enable the return of capital to investors who will seek to redeploy their profits and proceeds in new investment opportunities.

The DOGE and deregulation will drive government efficiency and make America a vastly better and lower-risk place to do business efficiently and effectively.

I am also hearing about non-US companies that are desperate to immediately create a presence on U.S. soil. They are frightened to be locked out of the most important economy in the world. They will build factories and make new investments here to avoid the risk of tariffs and because they don’t have a better place to invest capital.

The expectations for the second Trump administration are high.

House Republicans are set to meet with Trump to solidify their leadership team for the 119th Congress.

Speaker Mike Johnson, a Trump ally, is expected to easily win his party's nomination. Johnson pledged to bring ""total unity"" to advance Trump's agenda, with top leaders Steve Scalise and Tom Emmer also likely to keep their roles.

Johnson is confident about the January 3 floor vote, avoiding the drama that plagued past speaker elections.

Trump and Johnson plan to “iron out details” for a streamlined legislative strategy at Mar-a-Lago this weekend.

I'll say, they'll be fomoing again & again & again, cause my target is way higher than where it is now, and each pump just confirms that it's real.

My goal for $MAYA is 100 Million DOLLARS

For me, this is a historic play, so why would I care when I buy, when there's still 100x+ upside?

Many mistakenly rotate profits from winners to losers, thinking they'll catch up, but that's not the case.

Look at all the top memes—they gave thousands, hundreds of Xs, reaching $10M MC, and you know what they did next? They gave hundreds more Xs.

News reports say Black people—including children—in about half of the 50 US states recently received racist text messages stating that they had been ‘selected to pick cotton at the nearest plantation.’ These mass texts were sent from unrecognised numbers a day after Donald Trump declared victory in the 5 November US presidential election. Some messages referenced recipients by name and included ‘Trump supporter’ as a signature.

TextNow, a service that allows people to send text messages for free, said several users had sent out these messages and that it had shut down those accounts.

The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) condemned the incident and blamed Trump’s team. However, the president-elect’s campaign denied involvement.

The FBI announced it was investigating and is in touch with the US Department of Justice and other federal authorities.","Wed Nov 13 09:15:25 +0000 2024"
