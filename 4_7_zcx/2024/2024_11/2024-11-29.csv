A Romanian constitutional court yesterday, (Nov. 28th 2024) asked the official electoral authority to recount and verify all of the ballots cast, after attempts to cancel the election failed. The US - UK -  EU  & Romanian media have been non-stop smearing Mr Călin Georgescu, since he won the election round on 25th Nov. 

🔹 Mr. Georgescu won against 13 other candidates in the 1st round  with 22.94% of the votes. Media across the West and in Romania label  him 'pro- Russia', 'far-right', 'NATO critic' and 'ultranationalist' due to  his 'Romania first' position. He was not invited to presidential debates hosted by  Romanian media and didn't pay for political broadcasts on TV, but brilliantly used social media and podcast appearances to get his message out.  

🔹 The European Parliament's 🇪🇺 liberal political group, ""Renew Europe,"" Valerie Hyer, has called on TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew to appear before the European Parliament to address concerns of social media interfering in elections. ANCOM, Romania's telecommunications market regulator will ask for the suspension of the TikTok platform in Romania.

🔹 Romania's Supreme Defense Council met to discuss possible risks to the country and its electoral process stemming from social media. Protesting against the results have started using students also, supported by political parties & NGO's against Mr Georgescu. 

🔹 Mr. Georgescu holds a doctorate in pedology, a branch of soil science, and held different positions in Romania’s environment ministry in the 1990s. Between 1999 and 2012, he was a representative for Romania on the national committee of the UN Environment Program. He promotes peace for the Ukraine 🇺🇦🇷🇺 conflict and not escalation, supports the Romanian Orthodox Church, Romanian farmers, reducing import dependence, and ramping up local energy and food production.

We're in for the fight of our life. We are the enemy and President Trump and all his administration have targets on their back, literally!! If you haven't noticed yet, we're in a fight of good against evil.

Our incoming 45th and 47th President, Donald J. Trump, was targeted for assassination more than once. Picks for Trump's administration have been harassed by the press and lied about. Some have had threats against their life!

Some of our own party have promised to work against the MAGA/MAHA mandate. They are a threat! 

Even worse are the demonic (YES, I said it) Democrats, who serve Satan and are determined to use every dirty trick in the book to attack anyone who dares rise against them. They are Marxist Communists and are determined to take our Constitutional Republic, through a long-planned Color Revolution, into a tyrannical government (which our Founding Fathers warned against)!

Get your head on straight. Plan, prepare. These are powers and principalities we fight, not just flesh and blood. ""For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."" Ephesians 6:12

Keep your head on a swivel, keep your powder dry, and stay frosty. Level heads are required at this moment in time. And last but not least, PRAY!

This investment thesis examines a promising opportunity in the Solana ecosystem. 

DeFi projects have recently gained strong momentum, particularly after Trump’s election.

While we remain long-term supporters of Ethereum and its immense potential, it’s important to recognize its current struggles, including network fragmentation, high fees, and slower transaction times. 

These challenges have opened the door for Solana to emerge as a frontrunner in this bull market cycle. 

Against this backdrop, we’ll be introducing Sanctum and its token $CLOUD, a project we believe could become a major player in Solana’s DeFi sector

In this analysis, we’ll break down why $CLOUD represents an exciting opportunity, backed by strong fundamentals and an attractive R/R profile 👇","Fri Nov 29 14:25:26 +0000 2024"

As Christians, it is our duty to turn to You in times of distress and uncertainty. 
In the aftermath of the recent election, there has been an alarming increase in violent threats against President Trump and his supporters by those on the left who oppose his presidency. 
This is not only a threat to our nation, but to our individual freedoms and safety as well. 
In this prayer, we ask for strength and courage to stand up against these threats and defend ourselves, our families, and our fellow Trump supporters. 
We entrust ourselves to Your protection and guidance as we face and defend ourselves against these violent liberals, knowing that You are always with us. 
We pray that You, Father, may grant wisdom and discernment to those in positions of power to handle this situation with justice, but in the absence of justice, we will protect our own.
We also pray that these violent liberals have a change of heart when they see our strength and resolve, showing them the mighty light of Christ in the midst of this insanity. 
Let us unite in prayer, trusting in Your divine sovereignty and praying for Your will to be done in all things.
In Jesus' name

Instead of talking about gratitude this Thanksgiving, Joy Reid spent her airtime raging against Trump supporters and conservatives. Her message?

""Make your own dinner, MAGA. Troll amongst yourselves with Elon, and leave us alone.""

Oh, and don’t forget, she accused Republicans of ""worshiping Trump instead of Jesus"" and told Black women not to join white progressives in protesting the election. 🤦‍♂️

🦃 Excuse me, Joy…who’s crying over an election loss now?
Wasn’t it YOU who just told us all to “stop acting like we owe you”? Meanwhile, Trump supporters are out here winning and living rent-free in your head! 😂
👉 Here’s the irony:

She lectures about peace on Thanksgiving while dividing people even more.

Claims “Our Thanksgiving, our choice” while refusing to let others have theirs without judgment.
Calls out conservatives for “trolling” while dedicating an entire rant to…Trump supporters.
Joy, it’s giving bitterness, not Tofurky. 🍽️
🔥 Let’s talk about it:

Who’s REALLY dividing America here?

Why can’t liberals like Joy Reid handle Trump’s victory with grace?

Well Trump had to win in an actual primary with many candidates. He had to defend himself against 4 bogus criminal cases and 1 bogus civil one. 

He spent more time and money on lawfare than any candidate in American history. 

He did three events in three states for weeks before the election. He went on every source of alternative media and he held three rallies a night sometimes to packed audiences.
