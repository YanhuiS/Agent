Conservative author David Frum announced Wednesday that he has left the Republican Party following President-elect Trump’s victory in the 2024 presidential election.

“De-registered as a Republican today,” Frum, a staff writer at The Atlantic, wrote on the social platform X on Wednesday.

Frum, a former speechwriter for then-President George W. Bush, has held on to his party affiliation even as he has become a vocal critic of the former president and his influence on the Republican Party since the 2016 election.

In 2016, Frum penned an editorial announcing he was reluctantly supporting Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and urged his like-minded Republicans to follow suit, writing, “Your hand may hesitate to put a mark beside the name Hillary Clinton. You’re not doing it for her. The vote you cast is for the republic and the Constitution.”

In 2018, he lamented what he described as a party broken in two in an interview on HBO’s “Real Time with Bill Maher.”

“The Republican Party is a broken party,” Frum said in the 2018 interview. “And there are people who have served the Republican Party that was, and there are people who are volunteering to serve the Republican Party that will be.”

“It is important to understand that something new is taking the place of the Republican Party,” he added.

In recent years, Frum has expressed concern about the state of U.S. democracy. In a piece published Wednesday following Trump’s victory, Frum said Americans who did not vote for Trump now “need to prepare to live in a different America.

@fema is in BIG trouble!

A federal disaster relief official ordered workers to bypass the homes of Donald Trump’s supporters as they surveyed damage caused by Hurricane Milton in Florida, according to internal correspondence obtained by The Daily Wire and confirmed by multiple federal employees. 
A FEMA supervisor told workers in a message to “avoid homes advertising Trump” as they canvassed Lake Placid, Florida to identify residents who could qualify for federal aid, internal messages viewed by The Daily Wire reveal. The supervisor, Marn’i Washington, relayed this message both verbally and in a group chat used by the relief team, multiple government employees told The Daily Wire. 

The government employees told The Daily Wire that at least 20 homes with Trump signs or flags were skipped from the end of October and into November due to the guidance, meaning they were not given the opportunity to qualify for FEMA assistance. Images shared with The Daily Wire show that houses were skipped over by the workers, who wrote in the government system messages such as: “Trump sign no entry per leadership.”
It is unclear whether the same guidance was issued elsewhere in the country. The employees were part of a Department of Homeland Security surge capacity force team, meaning they volunteered from other DHS agencies to help an understaffed FEMA as it dealt with a second major hurricane in a span of just a few weeks. “I know they’re short-staffed, I thought we could go help and make a difference,” one of the employees said. “When we got there we were told to discriminate against people. It’s almost unbelievable to think that somebody in the federal government would think that’s okay.” 
The employee said it felt wrong to discriminate against Trump supporters when they were at their “most vulnerable.” 
“I volunteered to help disaster victims, not discriminate against them,” the employee said. “It didn’t matter if people were black, white, Hispanic, for Trump, for Harris. Everyone deserves the same amount of help.”The guidance came as the Biden administration was criticized over its sluggish response to Hurricane Helene in rural areas across the country. In Roan Mountain, Tennessee, for example, locals told The Daily Wire it took nearly two weeks for FEMA to show up. The town is located in Carter County, which voted 81% for Trump on Tuesday. 
The FEMA agents ordered not to help houses with Trump signs were operating in Highlands County, a deep-red area located in south central Florida that backed Trump by 70% on Tuesday. It was hit with tornadoes, torrential wind and rain, and flooding when Milton hit in October. 
In the chat, Washington said that it would be “best practice” to “avoid homes advertising Trump,” according to photos of the messages viewed by The Daily Wire. No explanation was given for this guidance, which included other recommendations like telling the workers to “practice de-escalation and preventative measures,” and to “avoid high salt diets and coffee.”Photos from the system used by federal relief workers to track what homes they visit showed that relief workers followed Washington’s guidance. Several addresses were marked “not able to access property” with listed explanations such as: “Trump sign no entry per leadership,” “Per leadership no stop Trump flag,” “Trump sign,” and “Trump sign, no contact per leadership.”
“If they had damage or lost power for over thirty-six hours, it was my duty to inform them of benefits to which they are entitled through FEMA,” one team member wrote in a complaint filed to DHS about the guidance. 
Washington is the Disaster Survivor Assistance crew leader for Highland County, a leadership chart reviewed by The Daily Wire shows. She did not respond to multiple phone calls or an email seeking comment on the guidance. 
Chad Hershey, Washington’s FEMA supervisor, told The Daily Wire that the agency is looking into the situation.
Hershey said: “We are aware of it.”","Sat Nov 09 21:20:46 +0000 2024"

The reason Trump accused Biden of “weaponizing” the Justice Dept. against him was because Trump himself did it repeatedly against his foes while he was president.

He will do it again.

This didn't happen 8 years ago. Trump supporters didn't feel like it was ""safe"" to come out.

The vibe is much different now. This election is completely different than 2016 and I think this energy will carry into Trump's presidency.

Feels like the ""gloves are off"" and Trump and his supporters aren't playing ""the game"" from a defensive position anymore. 

Supporters are proud and want to be seen.

Many of Trump's ""enemies"" are no longer resisting and are instead completely defeated or are kissing his feet.

Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Mark Cuban, and others are now talking about ""unity.""

In 2016, the left was emboldened by Trump's win (where he lost the popular vote) and launched this ""Resistance"" movement that carried on for four years.

You saw it in the streets, on the media, and even within the RINO wing of the Republican Party.

What we have now is a unified Right and a Left that is completely broken and humiliated.

Trump is walking back into Washington with a party that he completely owns with new powerful allies that he didn't have the first time around.

In both 2016 and 2024, Trump—like all populists—grasped and voiced the frustrations that people felt after five decades of policies detrimental to the middle class and implemented by both parties.  For a majority of Americans, that seems to have been reason enough.

Under Nixon, the U.S. abandoned the gold standard. This decision marked the start of wage stagnation and widened economic disparities, setting the stage for a growing disconnect between economic policy and the needs of everyday Americans.

Under Reagan, policies prioritized corporate interests and wealth concentration over the middle class, fundamentally altering the economic landscape. The middle class, once the backbone of American democracy, saw its interests sidelined, leading to a weakening of the societal cohesion that democracy relies on.  The U.S. national debt problem started here.

Under Clinton, economic priorities shifted even further. Globalization and policies favoring free trade over worker protections fueled a sense of economic disenfranchisement among the working class, who began to feel alienated from democratic ideals, as winning or “getting ahead” took precedence over preserving democratic principles.

Under Bush and Obama, military campaigns always seemed to find funding, but programs to support housing, healthcare and education —the middle class trifecta—never could.

Then came Citizens United, a Supreme Court decision that effectively placed corporate interests at the heart of American politics, giving the very few a disproportionate influence over the electoral process and legislative priorities. 

Democracy became a game increasingly stacked in favor of those with money and power, undermining the very idea of government by and for the people. 

In this election, the average American voiced their dissatisfaction with the current direction of the country, expressing a strong desire to “Make America Great Again.”  It’s the economy.  We’ve lost our middle class.

However one feels about President Trump’s ability to deliver a solution, he serves as the messenger of longstanding discontent, not its cause.","Sat Nov 09 22:14:42 +0000 2024"

Trump plans to shift U.S. foreign policy to focus on China, end wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and expand the use of tariffs. 

With a “peace through strength” approach, Trump’s second term could mean intensified global tensions, especially in his dealings with Russia, Iran, and Europe. 

His focus on the looming challenge from China may reshape U.S. alliances and trade policies.

Realistically if we had global elections he would win the popular vote in China, Nigeria, Sub-Saharan Africa, India, much of the Arab world. I can’t even explain why but so many people in the “Global South” love him and it often has absolutely nothing to do with policy but just general vibes. 

So many people in China support him even though huge part of his career is smashing China. There are so many people in Persia who support him even though he implemented crushing sanctions against Iran. 

I saw video the other day where people in Melbourne Australia were asked who they would support and like 90 per cent of Asian Australians in the video said they would support Trump. And this is our most progressive city.

Huge sections of the pro-Palestine movement support him at the same time Netanyahu, Ben Gvir and most of Israel support him. How does this even make sense? There was a reporter the other day who interviewed illegal immigrants lining up outside an ICE Center in the US and there were guys in the line expressing support for him. When asked about his deportation policy they just said stuff like “yeah but he doesn’t mean me.”

Trump or his surrogates say offensive things about whole entire demographics of voters and then they just go and out and vote for him anyway. I’ve seen legit Haitian illegal immigrants expressing support for him. Puerto Ricans supporting him. Muslims supporting him despite the Muslim Ban. The leader of the Tuareg independence movement in the Sahara supporting him. 

My best guess is that there is natural massive constituency for strongman politics plus Trump somehow floats above policy and concrete political questions in the minds of hundreds of millions of people which is probably because at this point he is basically the most famous person alive on Earth.

Not even kidding, Democrats probably need someone like Taylor Swift or LeBron James in 2028. You probably actually need someone on the same level of celebrity as Trump","Sat Nov 09 04:28:39 +0000 2024"

How we react to Trump Supporters is more important now than ever before! 

For many of us, me included, our first reaction to Trump regaining power is to lash out at those who put him there. 

But let's consider the consequences of that . . .

1. Nothing positive will come from spewing hate and anger. Given the information that was available to these voters before the election, nothing we say (or scream) is likely to change hearts and minds.

Calling them stupid and gullible will only make them dig in . . . Especially those who are indeed stupid and gullible.

2. Hate and anger justifies hate and anger. It makes them feel as though they made the right choice.

Many will think or say something like . . .

""Why would I support the candidate of a person who behaves like this?""

Like-minded people will agree with  them.

The right approach is to be kind and honest.

Kind Honesty:
• Displays confidence and control.
• Is more difficult to respond to.
• Makes them question their beliefs.
• Stays in the back of their minds.
• Sets the right example for others, regardless of their beliefs.

It also helps our mental health. We will feel better about who we are and how we behave.

3. It's important that we don't give tacit approval to their choices by acting as though everything is fine. It's not fine.

For me this means I communicate with kindness to those (Trump supporting family and friends) who call or drop by, but I don't:
• Offer to discuss politics.
• Offer options or assistance.
• Accept offers (or offer) to gather.

I have no desire to be around them.

My demeanor is intentionally kind, honest, and subdued. I no longer show an interest in their lives. I want them to know I'm disappointed in them, without directly saying so.

Pulling away, (but not angrily severing contact), is my way of showing my dissatisfaction with choices that could destroy my family's lives.

I believe this response is reasonable and (again) the last thing I want to do is send the message that their choices were 'okay' with me. They were not.

I understand that this is a tough call for some of you. But you need to know that it can be empowering.

It feels good to be true to yourself and what you believe in without being unkind.

Bottom line - If you remember nothing else I've said here today, remember this . . .

Our hatred defines and hurts us, not them.

Hatred didn't fight off Authoritarianism and Tyranny during WWII. 

Planning, Preparation, Action, and Perseverance did . . .

If we defeat the challenges before us, it will be those tangibles that will get us to victory!

So, Plan and Prepare . . .

Research ""Worse Case Scenarios"" that could result from Trump taking power again and create a plan for your family that includes emergency provisions (for a month or longer) and decide on a gathering location.

Considered it insurance. I hope you never need any of it.

But don't put it off. Once a disaster happens it's often too late to do anything about it.

Then, Act and Persevere . . .

Connect with like-minded people, protest, resist, and support others doing the same. Stay engaged in the fight! Never give up!

We can come out of this stronger than we ever were before!

Share your thoughts and take care of yourselves!

Friendly Reminder:

Many people were skeptical when RFK Jr. selected Nicole Shanahan as his VP, but she turned out to be an excellent choice.

Many were unhappy when Elon chose Linda Yaccarino as the new CEO of X, yet she has proven herself impressive.

Similarly, when Trump picked J.D. Vance as his VP, there was hesitation, but he has shown himself to be an outstanding choice.

I completely understand people’s hesitation and their desire to point things out. However, at some point, we need to recognize that 99.9999% of us don’t truly know what’s happening behind the scenes or who these people are. We have to trust our leaders to make decisions on our behalf, and so far, they’ve made solid choices.

Trump understands that his biggest mistake during his first term was surrounding himself with problematic individuals. I may have to eat my words in the coming months, but I genuinely don’t believe he’ll make that same mistake again.","Sat Nov 09 17:49:55 +0000 2024"

Listen carefully. Ears on. 👂

Sausage beaters down. 🌭

I want President Trump to succeed. His love for this country is undeniable. He ran a campaign of optimism and patriotism while Harris and her supporters degraded white men and the working class.

Trump has a vision for America. 🇺🇸

But, at the same time, I want Trump and the GOP-controlled Congress to make good on their campaign promises and carry out all of the tasks they constantly preach needs to be done. 

• Secure the southern border, actually finish the border wall and deport every ILLEGAL alien out of this country.

• End the wars in Russia/Ukraine and Israel/Palestine.

• Bring the economy under control and slash deficit spending. President Trump added more to the national debt than did Biden under his first term, that is a fact. I’m optimistic Elon Musk will guide him properly on this by getting rid of waste.

• Pull us out of the Paris Climate Accord and cut subsidies to solar PV and utility-scale wind farm projects [and instead use that money to deploy nuclear reactor technologies]. Also, decimate the green agenda once and for all.

• Actually drain the swamp by taking executive action to fire rogue bureaucrats who weaponize our justice system against their political rivals and Soros-funded DAs. Gut out our federal agencies and purge the trash by restructuring their oversight. We need is LESS government, not more of it. Trump expanded the government in his first term. Let’s hope he does not make this mistake again.

• Outlaw DEI in government offices and academic institutions.

These were his campaign promises and/or things that most GOP voters want.

Let’s hope they deliver on these, and if not, we hold Congress accountable in the midterms and vote out those refusing to put American interests first. 🗳️

If Trump and the GOP accomplish these, then good, I will be happy. 😃

If these things aren’t accomplished, I do not want to hear excuses. 💅

Americans voted red expecting there to be a change from the last four years. 

The ball is in your court come January 20, 2025. 🏐

Marn’I Washington ordered FEMA workers to “avoid homes advertising Trump”.

Because of this 20 @realDonaldTrump supporters in Florida were not given the opportunity to qualify for FEMA assistance after the hurricane.

This is yet another example of CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR and why we need to remove every one who suffers from TDS from the taxpayer's payroll. 

And FEMA's response: ""we have taken measures to remove the employee from their role"".

To hell with that, I want to see her ass charged and sued personally by those families.

And for those investigating her, Marn’I Washington uses 2 aliases (typical for criminals):

👉Mary Ann Adams
👉Mariana Gatlinburg (her newest one)

The Dem party lives in an echo chamber and is completely out of touch w common sense voters. So many missed opportunities to sway centrists. And when I say things like “There are hidden Trump supporters (due to fear of ppl being harassed and canceled) and no hidden Harris supporters, so don’t be shocked when Trump wins” my diehard leftist friends assume I’m a closet Trump supporter 

And my far right friends assume I’m a lefty because I straddle rural & urban. 

The fact is, I’m genuinely an independent thinker and voter. I try and share perspectives, listen to people’s opinions, and respect folks who have different ideas from mine as long as they’re based on facts, not blindly following a political party or a blatantly biased MSM who is spoonfeeding them propaganda. 

If this election surprised you, then you have 100% been living in a echo chamber and you are part of the problem. You need to engage w people who are unlike you. 

While I despise extremism on all ends, I loathe elitism even more. 

I’ll let the blacks and hispanics speak for themselves and not tell them whats best for their communities as so many middle-aged white folks love to do. 

The gays? Absolutely the same. 

All I can do is share my experiences as a hardworking wife and mother, small business owner who loves her community. 

Do I think Trump is a cure all for our nation and my wallet? No.

Let’s hope the pressure is on for him to do better than the last time. To come to center. More Vivek less Guiliani. 

Very few ppl in this world actually care about the color of skin or what ppl do in their bedrooms. We just want to be left alone and not live under the threat of cancellation for doing our own thing. 

There’s an opportunity for ppl to come to center. Fight extremism but that only works if your “ask” isn’t infringing on someone else’s rights.

//BLUF: FEMA WHISTLEBLOWERS LEAK ORDERS TO ABANDON TRUMP SUPPORTERS IN FLORIDA. ATTACKS/UNREST OCCURS IN AMSTERDAM FOLLOWING SOCCER MATCH. NORTH CAROLINA FREEWAY SHOOTING SUSPECT ARRESTED. RESEARCH MONKEYS STILL ON THE LOOSE IN SOUTH CAROLINA.//
-----BEGIN TEARLINE-----
-International Events-
Netherlands: Authorities are investigating following what appears to be a series of attacks involving Islamic soccer fans in Amsterdam. Local media outlets are claiming that Islamic “residents” of Amsterdam were deliberately targeting Israeli soccer fans after a local tournament match, which resulted in the arrest of 62x assailants so far. 5x victims were hospitalized as a result of the attacks, with all five being discharged from the hospital this morning with non-life-threatening injuries.
-HomeFront-
Washington D.C. – This morning the Department of Justice unsealed the indictments of a three-person cell of Iran-affiliated individuals who allegedly planned to assassinate Donald Trump. Farhad Shakeri, the alleged leader of the group, was allegedly communicating with Iranian officials to conspire to assassinate Trump at some point after the election because Iran had assessed that Trump would lose and therefore be an easier target due to his reduced Secret Service protection detail. AC: Two of the three alleged conspirators have been arrested as part of this larger investigation, however Shakeri himself remains at large.
South Carolina: As of this morning, the escaped monkeys from the Alpha Genesis facility have not yet been recaptured, though local authorities have reported that their general location is known and traps have been set to recapture them.
North Carolina: A man has been arrested following a series of random shootings over the past few days in Raleigh. Andrew Thomas Graney was arrested after he shot at random cars along I-40 and residences in west Raleigh. AC: Initial reporting indicates the Raleigh shootings may have been more of a mental health incident rather than a deliberate terrorism attempt. However, the assailant did manage to shoot eight separate vehicles over the past few days, all scattered throughout different ambush sites along the freeway. As such, this attacker did exhibit a higher level of planning and deliberation than is commonly seen with mental health incidents. As of his arrest, no motive has yet been released by authorities, and only one injury has been reported as a result of these shootings.
Florida: This afternoon, whistleblower testimony leaked to the media indicates that FEMA officials issued deliberate and specific guidance for aid workers responding to the Hurricane Milton disaster zone to avoid conducting visits to homes that displayed signage in support of Trump. Specifically, FEMA agents and volunteers from other Department of Homeland Security divisions were told to avoid approaching homes where Trump signs were displayed, with several leaked messages confirming this policy does exist, and that the residences of Trump supporters were skipped over by FEMA workers, and that aid was not offered to these people as required by law. This afternoon, a FEMA spokesperson confirmed in an email with the originating media agency that the reporting is accurate, and that “extreme actions” are being taken to rectify this situation.
-----END TEARLINE-----
Analyst Comments: As one might expect, the actions of FEMA employees to not render aid to people based on political ideology is exceptionally illegal in many ways if it is indeed true. At the moment, only one media outlet is running this story (so it’s single-source reporting), but photos and screenshots of the policy were provided in the original news story. FEMA has not yet made a statement directly to the public regarding this incident, as this story broke only a few hours ago.
Nevertheless, even taking into account the rather palpable (and largely accurate) pessimism regarding federal employees being held to any sort of accountability for anything at all, heads will very likely roll due to this exceptionally serious policy coming to light. In the short term, FEMA will undoubtedly try to say that this event was an “isolated incident” originating from a single employee, which is expressly what their alleged statement this afternoon suggested. FEMA stated that an individual with “no authority” to issue these orders was “removed from their roll”…which is carefully worded to insinuate that the individual who FEMA is blaming this on has not been fired or criminally prosecuted.
However, FEMA can lay blame on one person as they wish, but they cannot hide the overall message. One must note that these revelations came to light after the election was decided in Trump’s favor, and after all federal agencies attempted to gaslight the American people into thinking that FEMA was not intentionally targeting Trump voters with regards to their response to Hurricane Helene in North Carolina. This incident in Florida swings the spotlight back to the earlier complaints regarding FEMA’s inaction in North Carolina, which may finally receive more scrutiny and investigation. It is not clear as to if similar policies have been put in writing by FEMA employees still working in North Carolina, but in light of this exceptionally serious implication, an agency-wide investigation would not be uncalled for.
Furthermore, not ONE single federal employee objected to these blatantly illegal orders at the time they were issued, and EVERY single employee who knew about this policy worked to actively conceal it until well over a month after the crisis first occurred…and after the election was over, casting doubt as to whether or not anyone would have come forward if Trump had not won the election. Consequently, election interference concerns will also likely persist, as the deliberate withholding of emergency aid to people based on who they politically support is generally considered to be election tampering in the most deliberate terms possible.
However, in the long term, the truth will come out. Gaslighting is only effective if the subject doesn’t pick up on what manipulation being undertaken…outright and obvious lies no longer have the effect that they did in the past.
Regarding the incident in Amsterdam, these attacks took place in coordination with a soccer game, so it’s not really clear as to if this was general hooliganism, geopolitically-influenced violence, or a combination of both. The events leading up to the attacks are also not clear; it is unknown if these attacks were planned in advance or were more crimes of opportunity. As Amsterdam has a large population of Islamic migrants, this could be more akin to the result of hostile populations being in close proximity to one another, rather than being a deliberately planned terror attack. This is most sharply evidenced by 60+ people being arrested…but no deaths or serious injuries being the result of the attacks. If Islamic militants wanted to cause absolute mayhem and destruction during this incident, they certainly could have done so without question. Some of the attacks (as they were filmed on social media) were brutal, but the events of that night don’t exactly add up to being categorized as a large-scale terror attack as is currently being portrayed in the media. Nevertheless, the attacks have been shocking for a nation that, up until recently, has largely not seen street violence on this scale before.
