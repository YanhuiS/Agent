Here's what it encompasses:  - **Symbolism**: The ticker combines ""DJT"" (which stands for Donald J. Trump) with ""4700,"" indicating Donald Trump's potential role as the 47th President of the United States. This symbolism is further emphasized by the token's contract address starting with ""0x4700.""  - **Community Sentiment**: On platforms like X, #DJT4700 has been discussed with a mix of enthusiasm, speculation, and meme culture, often tied to Trump's political activities and the broader crypto market trends. Users have highlighted its potential for growth, especially in light of Trump's victory in the 2024 election, suggesting it could symbolize or benefit from Trump's presidency.  - **Market Interest**: There's a narrative around #DJT4700 suggesting it might perform well due to these political and cultural associations, with some users on X discussing its potential to reach high market caps, fueled by the thematic link to Trump's presidency.  - **Crypto Culture**: The token embodies the intersection of cryptocurrency with political and cultural commentary, often seen in meme tokens, where the value and popularity can be driven as much by community sentiment, social media buzz, and thematic relevance as by underlying technology or utility.  The discussion around #DJT4700 on X reflects both political enthusiasm and speculative investment interest, often with humorous or ironic undertones common in crypto culture. However, like many meme or politically-themed tokens, its real-world utility or longevity might be speculative, driven more by community narrative and less by fundamental value or widespread adoption for practical use.","Fri Nov 08 18:02:25 +0000 2024"

There are plenty of micro-explanations and micro-excuses for what happened in the presidential election of 2024.  And on the margins, any number of them—indeed, almost certainly, a combination of them—made the difference.  But their impact was only on the margins.  Don’t get me wrong—small margins and the factors that move them do matter, a lot, in elections—particularly in America in the 21st century.  They deserve careful analysis, but only to a point.  

For the bottom line is that these considerations are not what we must focus on first and foremost today.  What deserves the lion’s share of our attention are the facts that a major political party could have even considered nominating Trump despite his manifest criminality, moral depravity, psychological derangement, and cognitive deficiencies and deterioration—and that nearly half the country would have voted for him no matter what he did or said and no matter whom he had run against.  That was the ultimate problem in this election, and remains so. 

We suffer from a deep sickness in our national polity.  Far above all else, before it’s too late, thoughtful Americans of good faith must work together to confront, to better comprehend, and to ultimately address that grave and metastasizing ailment if our great experiment in self-governance is to survive.  Scapegoating and blame-assigning about anything else serves no end but to diminish our chances of overcoming our profound national moral crisis.","Fri Nov 08 14:03:56 +0000 2024"

In the wake of Donald Trump's decisive victory in the 2024 U.S. Presidential election, the cryptocurrency market has seen an unprecedented surge, with HEEHEE leading the charge toward what enthusiasts predict could be a parabolic increase in value. Here's why HEEHEE, a lesser-known but increasingly popular cryptocurrency, stands at the cusp of a significant rally:

Trump's Pro-Crypto Stance:

Donald Trump's return to the White House has been met with enthusiasm from the crypto community. His campaign promises included fostering a ""crypto capital of the world,"" which involved creating a strategic national crypto stockpile, similar to gold reserves, and promoting a more favorable regulatory environment. This shift from the previous administration's regulatory crackdown has given a massive boost to crypto assets across the board.

HEEHEE's Unique Position:

HEEHEE, unlike major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum, has carved out a niche with its community-focused approach and innovative use of meme culture. Its mascot, Woodford, a quirky character designed to appeal to both crypto veterans and newcomers, has become a symbol of the project's light-hearted yet ambitious vision for financial freedom.

Content and Engagement Strategy:

Stacked Content Release: The HEEHEE team has been strategically silent, amassing a treasure trove of content featuring Woodford. Now, with the political climate favoring crypto, they are poised to unleash this content, aiming to drive community engagement and investor interest. This includes animated series, interactive games, and educational content about blockchain and finance.
Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs): Several high-profile crypto influencers and KOLs have expressed readiness to push HEEHEE into the spotlight. These endorsements are expected to come in the form of video content, live streams, and social media posts, leveraging their large followings to spread awareness and enthusiasm.
Bullish Market Sentiments: The general bullishness in the market, driven by Trump's pro-crypto stance, has not only uplifted Bitcoin to new all-time highs but has also created a favorable environment for altcoins like HEEHEE. The sentiment is that if Bitcoin is set to thrive, so too are the cryptocurrencies that follow in its wake.

What Does This Mean for HEEHEE?

Increased Investment: Investors are likely to diversify into cryptocurrencies beyond the traditional giants, seeking high-growth potential in projects like HEEHEE. 
Price Surge: The combination of a supportive political environment, engaging content, and influential endorsements might just be the catalyst HEEHEE needs to break through its current valuation into a parabolic trend. 
Community Growth: With more eyes on HEEHEE, the community around this cryptocurrency is expected to expand significantly, leading to more robust development, partnerships, and possibly even listings on major exchanges.

Challenges and Considerations:

Conclusion:

HEEHEE's journey from an obscure token to potentially one of the fastest-growing cryptocurrencies post-election is a narrative echoing the broader market's reaction to Trump's victory. With a blend of humor, community spirit, and now political tailwinds, HEEHEE is not just riding the wave; it's looking to make its own. Keep an eye out for HEEHEE; with the right moves, it might just become the next big story in the crypto world. However, as always in the realm of cryptocurrencies, due diligence, skepticism, and a readiness for volatility are advisable.","Fri Nov 08 13:05:37 +0000 2024"

Donald Trump’s recent victory in the 2024 U.S. presidential election has marked a striking return to the political spotlight. As the 45th and now 47th president, Trump has broken the precedent of a non-consecutive presidential term—a feat not seen since Grover Cleveland in the 19th century. Trump’s campaign maintained a clear message: a promise to restrict immigration, rollback environmental policies, promote American manufacturing, and intensify the nationalist focus that defined his first term.

Key campaign themes included economic nationalism, particularly through tariffs and restrictions on imports. Trump argued that such policies would restore American jobs and protect industries that have suffered in recent decades. Despite concerns from economists who warn that such trade policies could harm the economy, Trump found support among voters from economically struggling, deindustrialized areas, and it was this backing that solidified his victory in critical battleground states.

A major component of Trump’s 2024 campaign was his strategic outreach through digital platforms and social media influencers. He leveraged support from prominent figures like Elon Musk, who played a substantial role in mobilizing young, male voters. Musk’s endorsement, along with substantial financial backing, boosted Trump's reach among younger demographics. This focus on connecting with younger voters through social media and podcasts allowed Trump to appeal to non-traditional conservative bases, making his campaign appear dynamic and in touch with the digital age.

In addition to his economic and digital strategies, Trump pledged to roll back many policies implemented after his first term. Environmental regulations and social policies were central targets, with Trump emphasizing a shift toward deregulation and the restriction of transgender rights, which has garnered both strong support and opposition. These policies were particularly resonant among his conservative base, which remains enthusiastic about a shift toward traditional values and reduced government intervention.

His running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance, brought a complementary focus on American nationalism and anti-establishment sentiment. Vance, a newcomer to Trump’s campaign, is known for his critiques of globalization and the decline of American manufacturing—both of which were instrumental themes in Trump's overall platform. This team helped drive voter turnout in key states like Ohio and Pennsylvania.

Internationally, Trump’s win signals the potential for a shift in U.S. foreign policy. During his campaign, Trump indicated that he would revisit trade relations, particularly with China, and continue his approach of emphasizing “America First” policies that prioritize U.S. interests over global cooperation. Analysts predict that Trump's return to office could lead to a more isolationist stance, which could impact the U.S.’s position on global climate agreements, NATO commitments, and trade alliances.

Despite legal controversies and political polarization, Trump managed to solidify his appeal across a mix of traditional conservative groups and new supporters, culminating in a victory that reflects ongoing divides within American society. His second term is expected to further solidify his legacy, whether through policy changes, judicial appointments, or his handling of pressing domestic and international issues. As he prepares for his inauguration in 2025, Trump’s approach to governance will shape the next four years and potentially leave a lasting impact on the trajectory of American politics.","Fri Nov 08 12:58:15 +0000 2024"

🟧 ExtraOrdinal Daily #44 | What will the Trump Future bring for Crypto?

Donald Trump’s re-election is expected to significantly impact U.S. crypto policy, marked by a shift toward regulatory leniency and industry growth. His administration plans to replace SEC Chair Gary Gensler, known for strict enforcement, with a more crypto-friendly figure. Dan Gallagher, Robinhood’s chief legal officer and former SEC commissioner, is a leading candidate, indicating a potential easing of regulations. Another name that has been floated was Mark, an attorney and republican government official who served as a Commissioner of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission since June 30, 2022. Hester Peirce, known as “Crypto Mom,” has declined the role but remains influential. Is has been suggested that the SEC could drop all their crypto cases, except for explicit criminal fraud related cases. Potential repeals of restrictive measures like SEC bulletin SAB 121 could enable traditional banks to offer crypto services and develop stablecoins.

Besides the president himself, crypto has seen an absolute tsunami of crypto-friendly candidates elected earlier this week. The positive effect of this blockchain wave could lay the foundation for true acceptance and adoption over the next four years. A key legislative focus is the “BITCOIN Act of 2024,” proposed by Senator Cynthia Lummis, to establish Bitcoin as a U.S. strategic reserve asset. Analysts suggest this move could drive institutional investment and push Bitcoin’s value to targets like $90,000 by year-end and $200,000 by 2025.

Trump’s pro-business stance promises reduced compliance hurdles for DeFi platforms and increased integration with traditional finance. This regulatory shift could enhance stablecoin adoption and elevate U.S. status as a global crypto leader, attracting institutional investment.

Post-election, Bitcoin ETFs, such as BlackRock’s IBIT, recorded significant inflows ($1.38 billion in a day), showcasing market optimism.

Economic strategies involving tax cuts and potential fiscal stimulus may benefit crypto as a hedge against inflation. Trump’s administration is poised to create a favourable environment for innovation, setting a precedent that could influence global policy and solidify the U.S. as a leading crypto hub.

🔶 Daily Alpha | Bitcoin Update, Better than OP_CAT?

A group of leading Bitcoin developers, including experts from StarkWare and Blockstream, has introduced a new method that could transform Bitcoin's programmability. In a paper titled ""ColliderScript: Covenants in Bitcoin via 160-bit hash collisions,"" the team presented a way to implement covenants—conditional transactions—without needing a contentious soft fork.

Covenants could enable advanced wallet functions, secure vaults, and more efficient layer-2 protocols. Unlike previous proposals like OP_CTV by Jeremy Rubin and OP_CAT, which require changes to Bitcoin's core code, this new approach avoids such modifications. While promising, the technique remains computationally intensive and costly to execute.

Ethan Heilman, co-author of OP_CAT, collaborated with Victor Kobolov, Avihu Levy from StarkWare, and Andrew Poelstra of Blockstream. StarkWare noted the potential for optimization despite current limitations.

Robin Linus, known for BitVM projects, praised the idea's ingenuity but pointed out practical challenges, citing potential execution costs exceeding $10 million. This breakthrough could help Bitcoin close the functionality gap with Ethereum while maintaining its robust security.

It’s amazing to see the flood of innovation that was sparked by the ordinal-induced Bitcoin renaissance, and we’re here for it!

🔶 Daily Alpha | Wizard of Ord First ever self custodial inscriber tool

Another amazing technological update, which isn’t just @lifofifo has launched the first-ever self-custodial inscriber tool. Its most amazing feature? It allows people to inscribe children to a parent without sending out or losing custody over the parent. This could have been a solution to the child-parent controversy that surrounded the BlockRunners Catrix Mint a few weeks ago. This is sure to inspire interesting practical innovations in collection creation, management and evolution.

Hear her story: “I cried when Trump won in 2016. Then, the morning after the election I ran out of gas at a 4-way stop with my little girl in the backseat. A man in a truck pulled up. He offered to drive me and my baby to the gas station—and even paid for the gas. He made sure I got back on the road safely. 
And he also happened to be a…Trump supporter. 
But to me, he was a Good Samaritan. And that moment changed everything for me.” 

If YOU have a #WalkAway story (or even a story about being a WalkWith), please film yourself and share it! Tag us @RealWalkAway and use hashtag #WalkAway—or post it in our #WalkAway Facebook group, which is rapidly growing since the election! America needs to hear these stories! It helps others to think critically and #WalkAway and speak out, which absolutely has an impact on our elections. 👏🇺🇸

A FEMA supervisor reportedly instructed relief workers to avoid homes with Trump signs while surveying hurricane damage in Florida.

Internal messages reveal homes were marked “Trump sign no entry per leadership” as staff were told to “avoid homes advertising Trump.”

A FEMA employee called this guidance “discrimination at people’s most vulnerable,” adding, “everyone deserves the same amount of help.” FEMA is investigating the claims.

And with President Trump’s win these scams are coming to an end - and these grifters are going to find new jobs

A Texas judge has struck down Biden’s policy allowing undocumented spouses and stepchildren of U.S. citizens to seek residency without leaving the country.

This decision arrives shortly after Trump’s election win, with his campaign promising major immigration crackdowns. 

Trump has pledged to deploy troops and the National Guard for mass deportations.

Experts warn that deportation at this scale could cost billions annually and disrupt countless families.

Trump has always been exceptionally kind to the LGBTQ+ community and made it clear that he would not sign a national abortion ban even if it made it to his desk (which would be impossible anyway).

The moment came to symbolize the warrior’s spirit in Donald Trump — and further galvanized a political movement under constant attack from Democrats and their surrogates in legacy media with incessant incendiary rhetoric.

In light of the Justice Department releasing charges in an Iranian plot to assassinate Trump, I'm getting questions about President-elect Trump's level of security after his big election win. 

Without providing too many details that could harm his security, he now really does have the full-package of Secret Service assets (minus the use of an Air  Force One-type military plane) that Acting Secret Service Dir. Ron Rowe has claimed he provided him after the Butler assassination attempt. Sources in the Secret Service community had disputed whether it was the full package before the election - but say now Trump really does have what he needs, calling the post-election upgrade ""substantial."" 

The upgrade includes having the White Hosue Communications Agency at Trump's disposal. The WHCA is staffed with military experts devoted to protecting all of Trump's and Vance's communications with the highest level of encryption. This is incredibly important considering the unprecedented level of hacking (that is still ongoing) by  Chinese operatives that has taken place during the campaign. Trump, J.D. Vance, and Kamala Harris, were among 40 U.S. politicians and officials who had their phones accessed in what Senate Intelligence Mark Warner called the worst case of hacking he's been briefed on during his entire tenure as chairman. 

Other security upgrades now that Trump is president-elect have to do with manpower and vehicles: Trump is now augmented with Presidential Protective Division (the most highly trained and elite) agents, supervisors, and vehicles. 

During the campaign, Trump had his regular Trump Detail agents AND a campaign shift. After the assassination attempt, Trump was upgraded to have senior experienced agents from PPD doing the lead for all major campaign rallies and outdoor rallies. 

The sites also had to have a PPD assistant senior agent in charge as the second supervisor to make sure everything was correct before his arrival, just as the Secret Service does on every presidential and vice presidential trip. Now all of Trump's events will have that same level of higher protection -- with additional highly trained agents. 

Other assets added to Mar-a-Lago include robot dogs patrolling the club's perimeter and other ""enhancements,"" at his Trump Tower residence in New York City,  according to the Secret Service. 

Secret Service protection is automatically provided to the children and grandchildren of sitting presidents, but Trump's son Barron Trump began his freshman year at New York University with Secret Service protection.

Trump now also will have daily intelligence briefings provided to him as a matter of law. The briefings are summaries of coordinated through the Office of the Director of National Intelligence with contributions from the CIA and other members of the Intelligence Community. During the campaign, Trump also received a form of these ODNI briefings, which can contain classified material albeit with certain limits, but it was done only as a custom, continuing a tradition dating back to 1952 when outgoing President Harry S. Truman recognized the need to bring then-candidate Dwight Eisenhower up to speed well before Inauguration Day.","Fri Nov 08 21:38:36 +0000 2024"

Here is a snippet:

This week, markets rallied with BTC up 8%, ETH up 14%, and SOL up 15% following Trump’s election win, signaling potential easing on crypto regulation. Solana has now surpassed BNB as the fourth-largest digital asset. Optimism is high for a more crypto-friendly SEC chair, increased regulatory clarity, and a potential Solana ETF in the coming years, attracting more institutional capital. Three Solana ETF applications have already been submitted this year by @vaneck_us, @21Shares, and @CanaryFunds.

Solana’s ambitious vision, as outlined by @aeyakovenko , aims to make it competitive with centralized exchanges like Nasdaq, creating a globally synchronized network without arbitrage opportunities. Achieving this goal involves three key upgrades: Bankless Leaders, Asynchronous Execution (AE), and Multiple Concurrent Block Producers (MCBP):
- Bankless Leaders allow block production without executing all transactions, improving reliability.
- Asynchronous Execution separates consensus from execution, allowing validators to work in parallel, significantly boosting transaction speeds and user experience.
- MCBP would enable multiple leaders to produce blocks concurrently, increasing transaction capacity and resilience.
Anatoly aims to implement AE by 2025, setting the stage for MCBP afterward. While some in the ecosystem have raised concerns, recent regulatory momentum suggests a brighter future for Solana. For those interested in a technical deep dive, Helius previously released a deep dive on these topics, and we will be releasing a piece on the Solana VM in December.

Willacy County, first time since 1972
Starr County, first ever with current boundaries
Duval County, first ever with current boundaries
Maverick County, first time since 1928
Webb County, first time since 1912

And now he’s gleefully pointing to the recent Botswana election as if it holds some magical “signal” for Zimbabwe. The real lesson he should be drawing is painfully clear: learn to concede defeat, and do so with dignity.

Zimbabwe is overdue for an opposition that demonstrates emotional and mental maturity - one that prioritises the nation’s interests over personal, ego-driven ambitions. Look around, Chamisa. In the U.S., when Harris’s side lost, they conceded. In South Africa, Malema did the same, and in Botswana, Masisi accepted his loss with grace. What’s stopping you from showing the same level of honour?","Fri Nov 08 10:42:43 +0000 2024"

Let’s be clear, these individuals should not be mistaken for genuine advocates of the Second Amendment or people truly invested in self-defense. This is not about authentic safety concerns; it’s an internet-driven trend that trivializes the gravity of responsible firearm ownership and self-protection.

I wholeheartedly welcome anyone, regardless of political alignment, who exercises their Second Amendment rights with integrity and respect. However, I won’t remain silent when individuals seek to turn this community into a stage for performative displays that mock our values. When people use firearms as tools of intimidation rather than self-defense, they undermine the principles this community holds dear, principles grounded in responsibility and respect.

If you genuinely feel unsafe and wish to defend yourself, then by all means, exercise your rights responsibly. But if you’re weaponizing false fear to posture and provoke, know that this community values authenticity and will call out any behavior that seeks to exploit it. After enough time in these circles, it becomes clear who is here to uphold our shared values and who is merely using this community for their own ends.","Fri Nov 08 10:31:04 +0000 2024"

The Democrats know exactly what they're doing by feeding these people to Trump and splitting the country because this is how neoliberal capitalism operates. Dumb everyone down. Make them fight. Rob them. Make infinite profit.

None of us are allowed to know that these people are actually within reach of leaving their cult for a left-wing populist that will bring the fight to Wall Street.

The most important point is that I know Jacob personally, and I can say his intentions are good. He is trying to be a peacemaker and promote reconciliation, and this comes from a good heart. So please don’t go after Jacob – he is a good man.
And of course being kind and having charity is always good. As followers of Christ, we should do this.
But there are many, many things that Jacob misses in this article, and frankly he shows a very one-side view of politics that I simply cannot ignore. The whole tone of his article is that somehow Trump supporters are ignorant, mean people who need to be reminded to be nice or else they will become brown shirted nazis, and this simply cannot be allowed to pass without a response.
Here are a few points that Jacob needs to be reminded of:
--Trump is not unusually immoral or bad. Like all presidents, he has some unfortunate characteristics and many good ones. This also applies to Trump supporters. If you know anything at all about the history of presidents, it should become obvious that Trump is not unique in terms of his personal conduct, and the claims that he is are simply ignorant and need to stop.
--Trump has been harassed and persecuted by bad actors relentlessly since 2016, and ignoring this history is harmful to the republic.
--Obama mounted a coup attempt against his successor, which has never happened before.
--The Deep State immediately persecuted Trump and his cabinet members like Michael Flynn.
--The Russia collusion process was based on Democrat campaign research and was complete fiction, and after three years the special prosecutor had to admit there was nothing there, yet the media accused Trump of being a Russian stooge throughout his presidency and continues to do so today.
--Trump never arrested a single journalist or political opponent, even though a strong case could be made that at the very least Hillary Clinton should have been prosecuted for destroying evidence regarding her email server while Secretary of State.
--Both impeachment attempts were completely unprecedented in their lack of evidence of any actual crime and were clearly simply political persecution.
--The media invented lie after lie about Trump, especially the “many fine people hoax,” and they never apologized about it.
--The entire Jan. 6 debacle was planned and executed by the Deep State, with hundreds of FBI agents firing up the crowd and Capitol police deliberately opening doors to encourage people to go into the Capitol.
--When Trump was out of office the FBI was weaponized against him, raiding his private home with kill orders. Yes, kill orders.
--When Trump announced he would run for office again the Biden administration coordinated at least four completely baseless lawfare campaigns against Trump with the explicit intent of bankrupting him so he could not run for president.
--Trump was shot once and the government has completely covered up the investigation, and we still do not know what happened. The second attempt was carried out by a person with clear Deep State connections.
--Trump supporters were called Nazis, fascists, garbage and the media claimed there would never be another fair election. The media continues to fabricate lies about Trump – just to cite one example, we have the claim that Trump wanted to kill Liz Cheney with a firing squad, which was clearly mendacious.
--Yet, throughout all of this, Jacob somehow comes to the conclusion (without mentioning any of the history) that somehow it is incumbent on Trump supporters and Trump supporters only to reach out to console the losers, the same people who have lied, harassed, broken laws and tried to kill Trump without surcease since 2016.
Sorry, Jacob, I love you brother, but this is just a bridge too far.
This country needs justice. Many of these people need to be put in jail, not consoled.
And by the way, since when it is kind to help people maintain delusions that are clearly untrue?","Fri Nov 08 02:39:50 +0000 2024"
