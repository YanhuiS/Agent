The New York Times interviewed Scientific American editor Laura Helmuth’s resignation after she labeled Trump supporters as “bigoted” and “fascists” on social media. 

Helmuth apologized, attributing her remarks to “shock and confusion about the election results.”

Rather than focusing on the backlash, NYT highlighted Helmuth’s career achievements and framed her departure as reflective, even noting her plans to “go bird-watching.”

As expected, NYT took a notably lenient stance toward a figure whose role demands neutrality in science journalism... something she failed miserably at.

President-elect Trump is reportedly considering Fox Business Network host and former National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow for a high-level economic policy role in his new administration.

Sources suggest Kudlow could be tapped to lead either the National Economic Council or possibly the Treasury Department.

They reportedly recently met at Mar-a-Lago to discuss potential plans.

Every day was waking up to a new adventure in trying to predict both policy and personnel. A scandal that lasted a week in 2015 would last maybe 3-4 hours in 2017, immediately overtaken by a newer scandal or a ridiculous tweet.

In his first term, Trump hired and fired a plethora of Cabinet officials (yes, jefe, a plethora). People advertised as ""the best"", when nominated, ended up as a ""disloyal bozo"" a few months later. For perspective (and not to say its a better way of doing it!), Biden had only 2 Cabinet members leave, one to run the National Hockey League lol. Conversely, many of Trump's positions turned over multiple times & only five Cabinet members survived through Trump's whole administration -- almost. Two of the five resigned after January 6th.

The previous Trump term ended with not only total insurrectionist calamity in real life, but gigantic prediction market flips -- almost every single hyped and heavily-traded PredictIt market on whether a Senator would object in the January 6th certification flipped and expired to ""No"" as the Senators were displaced in the chamber by rioting jagoffs. Tuberville, Loeffler, etc. all went from like 97% for Yes to expiring at 0 in the span of a few hours.

All of us traders started the day trying to predict whether Ron Johnson, Tuberville, and a rogue's gallery of Republican Senators would certify the election -- we squinted at the pixels on C-SPAN to see if Senators were huddling up and plotting. But the day unfolded with us watching the same exact chamber (that always looks sleep-inducing) being overrun by hypercaffeinated morons with zip ties looking to kidnap the Vice President. A little surreal!

Now the gang is headed back to town, and after looking relatively calm for a few days - including a few normal personnel picks - the new administration is picking right back up with the calamitous and chaotic bit.

Right out of the gate, multiple of Trump's bizarro Cabinet picks are trading at <80% to be confirmed (Hegseth, Tulsi, and RFK Jr.) -- including easily the worst received nomination in decades: Matt Gaetz. He is sitting at ~40% odds to be made the #1 lawman in the nation. 

The vibe of the Gaetz nomination hitting the Senate (if it gets that far) will be less like Robert Downey Jr being politely grilled in Oppenheimer and probably more akin to a prolonged horror like The Exorcist or Oldboy.

It's no secret that prediction markets thrive when Trump is involved - because nobody knows what the hell is coming next. Not even the people who are paid to know what is coming next have much of an idea what is coming next. Cue the spokespeople confidently saying X, only to have Trump tweet out an hour later that anyone who likes X is an idiot and we're doing Y.

If you want a preview of what's MAYBE to come: fluoride being recommended out of the water by the Trump admin is up to 42%. The JFK assassination files being immediately released? Up near 40%. That's in addition to mass deportation (trading at 70% to start on day 1). It's obviously not all negative or wacky news across the board -- crypto is skyrocketing (Trump immediately buying bitcoin with the US Treasury is at 30%) and business owners are probably feeling more optimistic about the decreased regulations of the new regime. 

Regardless of whether your own life will be improved or worsened, everyone around the world should be buckling your seat belts and holding onto your butts. The chaos is coming. If you want to have a slightly better clue of what is happening, make sure to peep into the prediction markets over the next 4 years. We're definitely still a bit clueless, but with money on the line, we've got a better grasp of it than every other source.","Fri Nov 15 16:09:04 +0000 2024"

Trump is suing The New York Times, CBS, and others for $10 billion, accusing them of “industrial-scale libel” and election interference.

To win, Trump must prove “actual malice”—that these outlets knowingly lied or ignored the truth—a high bar set by the Supreme Court in New York Times v. Sullivan to protect press freedom.

Past cases have shown it’s tough for public figures to win defamation suits, but a victory could reshape limits on media coverage of politicians.

🟧 ExtraOrdinal Daily #50 | Six-day Trump Induced Buying Spree Slows Down

After a week of unstoppable bullish momentum, with Bitcoin Spot ETFs reaching nearly half a trillion dollars in trading volume, the market saw its first day of negative ETF inflows, with $400 million in outflows over the last 24 hours. This dip is likely due to hawkish comments from Fed Chair Powell, who cast doubt on a December rate cut previously seen as a given. While some view this as a healthy pause after recent volatility, indicators suggest potential for further gains. Meanwhile, bullish sentiment remains fueled by rumors of SEC Chair Gary Gensler stepping down and the pro-crypto stance of the anticipated Trump administration, with advocates like Michael Saylor urging investors to focus on long-term growth.

🔶 Daily Alpha | NatCat the CryptoPunks of BTC?

The Digital Matter Theory (DMT) sub-ecosystem, known for its innovative fusion of art, mathematics, and Bitcoin, has faced waning interest after initial hype. Collections like @dmtnatcats once dominated trading volume but now struggle for attention. NatCat remains a potential “grail” if the DMT framework or the collection regains prominence in the crypto scene. Comparisons to Ethereum’s CryptoPunks in @bitoordileone infographic, highlight NatCats’ potential. 
Similarly, The Royals, another DMT-based project praised for its simplicity and style, recently enjoyed a price boost after a mention at DevCon 2024, possibly signaling hope for a broader DMT revival.

🔶 Daily Alpha | Kraken Lists Rune Perpetuals

@krakenfx decision to list perpetual futures for Runes marks a significant expansion, bringing tokens like $DOG into centralised futures trading.

Traders are now watching to see if perpetual trading breathes new life into the rune — and if it does, we might finally have an answer to the age-old question: “Who let the dogs out?”","Fri Nov 15 17:22:27 +0000 2024"

More than two dozen women have made such claims against Trump, including E Jean Carroll, who was awarded nearly $90m total in two civil trials after jurors found that Trump sexually abused and defamed her. She said on X: “I tried to tell you.”
Several survivors of sexual assault interviewed by the Guardian, as well as advocates for persons who have suffered abuse, said they were not surprised by Trump’s win. They felt it was another example of how sexual abuse is not taken seriously, or pointed to the fact that powerful people who perpetrate abuse seem to be able to avoid repercussions.
Stacey Williams, who said she met Trump through Jeffrey Epstein about three decades ago, and told the Guardian that the now president-elect groped her at Trump Tower in 1993 in what seemed to be a “twisted game” with the late sex predator, is among the many processing election results.
“I think what we were all hoping was that [the] truth would come through and the stories would affect people’s vote once they had [them] in front of them.”
But, she said: “Disinformation won this election at the end of the day, and if we don’t figure out an answer for that, I don’t have a lot of hope for this country.”","Fri Nov 15 17:21:18 +0000 2024"

Gov. Bill Lee expressed strong support for Trump’s proposal to dismantle the U.S. Department of Education, calling it a step toward empowering states and parents in education policy.

Lee tied Trump’s victory to renewed momentum for his state’s new school choice bill, which proposes 20,000 scholarships for students, including $7,000 each for low-income families.

The bill also includes teacher bonuses and increased public school funding.

Lee dismissed claims that school choice hurts public schools, calling it a path to innovation and improved outcomes for all students.

And it gets even better...

The $6.6 billion grant agreement with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company was made possible through the historic Chips and Science Act, a piece of legislation that will end up as an enduring part of Biden's legacy.

""Today’s announcement is among the most critical milestones yet in the implementation of the bipartisan CHIPS & Science Act, and demonstrates how we are ensuring that the progress made to date will continue to unfold in the coming years, benefitting communities all across the country,"" said Biden.

The grant is predicted to create a staggering $65 billion in private investment from TSMC in Arizona, including three new facilities and tens of thousands of good jobs.

Donald Trump blames immigrants for our problems. President Biden works to actually fix them and strengthen our nation.

The downgrade from Trump and Biden is going to be felt in every corner of our economy.

Wow! Who would have thought that one day I'd be part of a story where @realdonaldtrump and Stephen Akintayo are mentioned in the same breath? 

Looks like all my posts supporting Trump’s policy direction on housing and land banking over the years have finally come full circle. This news just had me cracking up—now if only this were true!

From my posts about his business sense to my cheers for his election strategies, it’s clear I’ve seen a lot of value in Trump’s approach to leadership, love him or not. 

And here’s the thing: if Trump did offer me this position, I'd bring some African flair to it. Imagine mixing our culture's resilience with American land strategies! We’d make property investment great again in ways no one’s ever seen before!

So, what do you all think? If this was real, should I take the role? 👀

I never thought I’d say this, but today I’m grateful to Donald Trump. While I had my criticisms of his first term—particularly in expanding the swamp and increasing the national debt—today something changed. President Trump kept his word. 

One day, you’ll feel the same about Robert F. Kennedy Jr. It may seem unlikely now, but imagine a future where your medicine cabinet isn’t overflowing with pills, where doctors focus on cures rather than temporary fixes, where your loved ones live longer, healthier lives. A future where the mental health crisis has eased and chronic disease no longer cripples our nation.

This is the vision Kennedy brings. He has the courage to challenge the status quo and prioritize genuine health over profit. It’s time we give him a chance—because the alternative is more of the same: more illness, more despair. 

This last year I was able to completely turn my health around-naturally. My hope is that everyone can feel the joy I feel and with Kennedy, we have a real opportunity to make things better. I am so excited for the future🇺🇸

Trump is set to nominate North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum as Secretary of Interior, signaling a potential shift in federal land and energy policy. 

The choice of a leader from one of America's top oil-producing states suggests Trump's Interior Department will prioritize domestic energy production.

Burgum brings unique credentials to the role: a successful tech entrepreneur turned governor of a state that balances energy development with agriculture and conservation. 

Under his leadership, North Dakota has maintained its position as the nation's second-largest oil producer while also investing in carbon capture technology.

I’m sorry for this, I know you’ve spent so many nerves on it and I realise nerves can’t be restored. 

This is so fun to see your hypocrisity. You like to talk about democracy or justice on dozens of forums or documentaries but in face of real problem you just concerned and mumbling smth while north korea, iran get into war on russia side. They provide russia with bombs and you provide us with petitions, presentation and memorandums. Thank you, I always knew that Excel spreadsheet is very effective against Iranian drones. 

They are killing childrens everyday and UN head shake hands with them. As I understand the best Antonio Guterres can do to stop putin for couple of minutes is masturbate his dick. Masturbate with two fingers because it’s peace sign.

I wish you all to live in conspiracy nonsense you deserve with your own stupidness. You did nothing to stop it. You didn’t change your lifestyle to face new reality like we in Ukraine do. It would be much better if you all were authoritarian regimes. In this case you will release us from listening your hypocrisy shit how concerned you are. Just say “we don’t fucking care” and live your life. I had so many interviews with foreign journalists about “culture and humour during war”, cause that’s my topic. And all your questions, journalists, made me fell that I speak with 9-years old kids who is writing essay for school.

Look at all these sheep bleating the same line about how Trump's cabinet picks are nothing to worry about because he had John Bolton in his cabinet and only used him as leverage to intimidate other countries while making peace.

The lion's share of the evil foreign policy decisions Trump made during his first term happened while Bolton was his national security advisor. Vetoing congressional efforts to end the US-backed genocide in Yemen. Staging a coup in Venezuela and killing Venezuelans with starvation sanctions. Arresting Julian Assange. Bombing Syria on false pretenses. Pulling out of the Iran deal and smashing Iran with starvation sanctions. Numerous cold war escalations against Russia. Escalations on Israel-Palestine like moving the embassy to Jerusalem and honoring Israel's illegal annexation of the Golan Heights.

They're falsely citing Bolton as evidence that Trump's hawkish cabinet picks don't mean he'll promote hawkish foreign policy, when the evidence says the exact opposite. All these war sluts he's stuffing his cabinet with will absolutely be shaping the foreign policy of his administration. That's what they are there to do.","Fri Nov 15 03:01:27 +0000 2024"

If Trump succeeds in dismantling the Affordable Care Act, the Department of Education (which funds public schools and colleges), the EPA (responsible for environmental regulations protecting air, water, and land), and makes cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and veterans' benefits—as well as eliminating NOAA, reducing FEMA funding, and laying off thousands of federal employees—along with ending various tax credits such as the $7,500 EV tax credit and the $2,000 child tax credit for those with a modified adjusted gross income of $400,000 or below, where will the savings go?
Trump has promised tax cuts for middle- and lower-income families. If this is the case, how much will these families actually save? Will people making under $400,000 see real financial benefits, or will the majority of these savings be directed toward tax cuts for the wealthy?
I am genuinely interested in hearing your honest thoughts on this.","Fri Nov 15 02:56:53 +0000 2024"

“Trump’s win, driven by a broad multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-religious coalition, puts DEI on life support.”💥

Pres Trump can help speed up the process by “Cutting off the supply of money that feeds the DEI industrial complex on campuses and elsewhere.”

The federal government must eliminate funding for any program, anywhere in the federal government, that includes race- or ethnicity-based eligibility or preferences — including the use of DEI statements for admission, hiring or promotion.
Indeed, it’s also time to cut federal funding completely for any institution, public or private, educational or otherwise, that uses such discriminatory DEI criteria.

People are entitled to their viewpoints, but they are not entitled to federal money to promote discriminatory conduct.

After President Trump’s landslide win, Florida deserves an America-First Senator who will fight alongside him to Make America Great Again

Here is my commitment to my fellow Floridians:

1. I will take no salary and instead donate it to crisis pregnancy centers across the state.

2. Before every key vote, I will meet in-person with my fellow Floridians to hear what they think.

3. I will only serve the remainder of Senator Rubio's term (January 2027) and will not seek re-election. 

Why am I giving myself only two years?

1. Because deadlines are good. They put pressure on us to get our best work done.

2. I am not a career politician.

Governor DeSantis will now have to appoint a new U.S. Senator to serve until January 2027.  Florida needs a Senator to fight alongside President Trump in Washington to secure the border, rebuild the Trump economy, restore meritocracy, and Make America Great Again.
