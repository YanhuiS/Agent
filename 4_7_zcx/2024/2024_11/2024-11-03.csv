Both camps that support these two candidates, i.e. Republicans and Democrats, have the same goal, which is to dismantle China, which is the financial pillar of BRICS.  

Every single politician in the US has already publicly stated this, and it is not a secret at all.  The difference is that both camps have a different idea and a different path to the ultimate goal.  

Kamala and the Democrats want to do this through Ukraine and a defeat for Russia, economic ruin, and its fragmentation into smaller vassal states.  This will immediately bring them to the Chinese border.  Later, they can focus on Iran and in the name of Israel, dismantle Iran with some helpful pro-LGBT regime.  

The pro-Trump Republicans were initially the most vocal supporters of Ukraine, but since the conflict in Israel flared up, they are firmly determined to leave Ukraine and head for the road to China via Iran.  The Jewish lobby has far more control amongst the republicans than the democrats, which has bought them with all their underwear.  They intend to replace the already lost war in Ukraine with the road to China, but through Iran.  

Trump has stated clearly and loudly several times that he wants to stop the war in Ukraine, (so that he can completely focus on Iran) and allow Netanyahu to ""finish the job"" ( he stated this several times) that is, to finish the genocide against the Palestinians.  

Trump is already determined to go to war with Iran in the name of Israel.  To collapse Iran and then trough Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, ro came to the border with China and at the same time to the border with Russia. 

After that they will put military bases and logistics there, install some missile, rockets, infiltrate NGO spies and traitors and so on.

It is already clear to the democrats that the war with Russia is lost if they do not find a new people stupid enough to go to war with Russia like the Ukrainians, who no longer manage to mobilize a sufficient number of soldiers.  

Republicans and Trump on the other hand will immediately offer a truce to Putin and target Iran and support Israel.  Trump said the other day that he knew how to break the friendly relationship between Russia and China, and that is very true.  He will offer Putin, Russia's entry into NATO and acceptance into the Western sphere which is under the control of the Jewish powerful lobby in Washington and the United States itself, all in order to attack China through Iran.  

The US is currently using Taiwan to drag China into war, but the problem is the geographical position of Taiwan, which in case of war will be completely cut off from supplies.  

So if the Democrats and Kamala win and if they fail to find a new people stupid enough to push them into a new war with Russia and an attempt to continue the pressure on the Russian state and the Russian economy, they will most likely accept the plan of the Republicans and Trump, which is a war with  Iran.  

Whoever wins a war with Iran will be.  Therefore, it is wisest for the Iranians to seriously start their work.","Sun Nov 03 21:03:44 +0000 2024"

“Elections in the United States, the most democratic country in the world.

In scene the largest conservative leader in modern time: Donald Trump.

How was the world under his administration? The United States projected power. We did not have new wars. There was peace throughout the world.

Today we see wars, terrorism making a comeback, and censorship restraining us all.

The return of Trump is the certainty for a better world. No wars, no terrorism, and a return to liberty in its purest form. 

Speaking on behalf of all Brazilians who love God, the state of Israel, respect the traditional family, private property, free markets, and free speech — our sincere best wishes.

Jair Bolsonaro, former president [of the Federal Republic of Brazil], ineligible to hold office without committing a single crime.

We are united!”","Sun Nov 03 23:15:28 +0000 2024"

There’s no point being subtle about it. Dems are cheating. They do it with censorship, voter suppression, illegals, drop boxes, mail-in voting, broken machines, and lack of voter ID.

Legacy media is, of course, in the bag for the dirty Democrat Party as is Big Tech, Big Pharma, and Big Entertainment.

America will only survive past this election if Trump wins and wins overwhelmingly.

Do you feel small and insignificant?

That’s nothing compared to how you’ll feel if Kamala Harris cheats her way into office again and takes away our rights like she’s promised.

But there is hope. You still can vote and change history. So do everything you legally can to get yourself, friends, family, and strangers to vote for Donald J. Trump.

Together we can move mountains. We can change the course of history. We can inspire humanity. We can make it to Mars. We can become healthy again. We can put an end to government abusing us. We can inspire ourselves and our neighbors. We can stand up for all of those who Kamala Harris has knocked down.

We can save America now.","Sun Nov 03 19:38:01 +0000 2024"

I don’t. Harrison Ford, once the great Han Solo, endorses Harris – where is Darth Vader when you need him?

Harrison Ford endorses Kamala. A man who made a business, and a life, out of playing characters the Democrats, and the establishment despise. He proves he is nothing like the men he played, as he spoke the lines written by others.

His characters are more popular today than they've ever been because they are an island of hope, of remembering what being a man was - no - what it is. An island of truth. We still exist and as controversial as it sounds, we are needed now more than ever.

In Australia the useless moderate Liberals in NSW demonise men - real men. They are fine with the LGBTQI+, third wave feminists and the climate alarmists. But they don’t want to represent men, or the women who love them. When in government, they absolutely destroyed consent laws, and innocent, decent, falsely-accused young men are being exonerated in court with costs, on the regular.

The Greens and Labor positively despise men. They put forward weak-sauce grifters and slippery-fish. They put forward aggressive women, and people who actually don’t much like Australia or humans at all.

Don’t for a second think that these politicians who don’t like men are in some way supportive of women, because the great secret is, they don’t like women either. They can’t even define the concept for fear of offending a soft-headed fellow traveller.

They carry on about front holes, bonus holes and letting men in women’s toilets by way of right - as somehow noble. They denigrate motherhood and screech about the made up conflation that is the so-called gender pay gap.

It is not who Harris and her ilk would govern for that bothers me, not nearly as much as who they govern against. They govern against the ordinary decent men and women of the world who pay their taxes, work hard, and just want to have a quiet family life. They want a holiday every now and then, and just want a meal out from time-to-time.

Instead, the entire system that Harris represents (the system that encompasses moderate Liberals, Labor and Greens politics), governs for the wealthy, connected and elite few. It governs for grift and scam. It covers its obvious malevolence with celebrity endorsement and faux care.

It bullies in the name of anti-bullying.

It encourages crime in the name of justice.

It kills the poor defenseless Squirrel named Peanut - in the name of animal welfare.

It is a lie, a fraud, a paid actor delivering lines written by others, in a story it does not understand, for people it will never really know.

It is a big, horrible movie. A horror movie. It started over 30 years ago, and it has been at the box-office across the West ever since. It plays to sell-out crowds, gorging on popcorn and sugary drinks instead of real, wholesome food.

But the credits are rolling for the final time this November. The moviegoers have woken up to the absolute tragedy, and the pain has set in. Too much sugar and popcorn make us sick. Too much empty nothing makes us weak. Too much fantasy shame makes us sad.

Trump represents hope. A new hope. A new beginning. A force of light in the darkness, a force of substance and creativity.

No more empty Hollywood people. No more vapid cackling politicians. No more faux shame.

No more climate alarmism. No more gender confusion. No more blurred borders. Evidence based policy putting nations first. 

I say Trump must become the leader of the free world, so we, the men and women living in it can start to remember what free once meant.

Let’s make the world great again.

I am a proud Australian and I endorse Donald J Trump.

On Bill Maher’s HBO Show on Friday, Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) appeared to repeat his reservation about accepting a Trump win in the presidential election. Raskin said that Democrats will only support a “free and fair election.” Trump was widely criticized for the same position when he said “If everything’s honest, I’ll gladly accept the results.”

“It’s going to be up to us on January 6th, 2025 to tell the rampaging Trump mobs that he’s disqualified. And then we need bodyguards for everybody and civil war conditions.”

Raskin went on HBO to repeat his reservation on accepting the results of any Trump victory:

“When I say we will support a free and fair election, no, we we’re not going to allow them to steal it in the states, or steal it in the Department of Justice or steal it with any other election official in the country.

If it’s a free and fair election, we will do what we’ve always done. We will honor it.”","Sun Nov 03 22:13:48 +0000 2024"

When he spews hate without volume like this - it's eerie, even to his supporters, because it doesn't drive enough dopamine for them, and that, they notice. 
    You can hear the buzz - they're talking under their breath during his speech - probably asking each other what's wrong with him. 
    He's partly on auto pilot - accordion hands and repetition - and partly feeling narcissistic mortification - seeing visions of his own demise, and recognizing it's HIS defective self that is responsible for it. 
    Two examples - his uncharacteristic use of the word ""please"" when asking for support - a word he almost never uses at rallies, and his statement that he ""never should have left the White House in 2020."" 
    Narcissistic mortification is untenable and irreconcilable to a malignant narcissist like Trump, who had attained lofty levels of grandiosity. It's death by embarrassment.
    Soon, he will lose the election. And the noise he makes after - it won't go over so well. 
    And the reality of his looming sentencing and other criminal trials will set in. 
    And then - the biggest and most hurtful thing possible to him sets in next - recognition that future grandiosity will be forever out of reach. 
    This sets the stage for narcissistic collapse.","Sun Nov 03 18:12:34 +0000 2024"

In an election that's set to redefine American politics, Rasmussen Reports' head pollster Mark Mitchell has just dropped a bombshell: Donald Trump is on track for a landslide win akin to Ronald Reagan's iconic 1980 victory! Here's what you need to know:

Trump's Lead: Mitchell indicates that Trump isn't just leading; he's surging ahead in both national polls and key battleground states.

Echoes of 1980: Just like Reagan's sweeping victory over Carter, Trump's campaign is resonating with voters, promising a political realignment.

Unprecedented Support: Despite what some mainstream media might have you believe, Trump's base is stronger than ever. Mitchell notes Trump's lead is ""Trump plus two"" in the national popular vote, a significant margin.

Potential Swing State Sweeps: If current trends hold, Trump could sweep critical swing states, a move that could echo or even surpass the 1980 landslide.

Why Now? The dissatisfaction with the current administration's policies, economic handling, and foreign affairs has voters turning to Trump's proven track record for a return to stability and prosperity.

This isn't just an election; it's a movement towards reclaiming America's greatness. Share if you believe in America First! 

A breakdown of the Rasmussen's forecast:   

- Trump 297 electoral votes 
- Harris 241 electoral votes  

Georgia - Trump 51-46%
 North Carolina - Trump 50-47% 
Wisconsin - Trump 50-47% Nevada 
- Trump 49-47% Pennsylvania 
- Trump 49-47% Arizona 
- Trump 48-46% Michigan 
- Harris 49-48%

🔰Here are some detailed reasons that may resonate with voters:

💠Economic Policies : Proponents argue that Trump's economic policies, including tax cuts and deregulation, led to significant job creation and economic growth during his presidency prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Supporters believe that a return to similar policies could help revive the economy.

⚜️Immigration Reform : Trump has been a strong advocate for stricter immigration policies, emphasizing border security and the need to reduce illegal immigration. Supporters argue this approach can lead to safer communities and better job opportunities for American citizens.

💠America First Foreign Policy : The ""America First"" stance emphasizes prioritizing American interests in foreign affairs, including negotiating better trade deals and reducing military engagement in overseas conflicts. Supporters believe this approach can enhance national security and economic standing.

⚜️Judicial Appointments : Trump appointed three Supreme Court justices and numerous federal judges, shaping the judiciary for generations. Supporters often highlight this achievement, believing that these appointments align with conservative values and constitutional interpretation.

💠Tax Reduction and Deregulation : Trump’s administration implemented significant tax cuts and rolled back numerous regulations, which supporters claim stimulated business growth and increased individual wealth.

⚜️Conservative Values : For many voters, Trump represents a commitment to conservative social values, including religious freedoms, gun rights, and opposition to certain aspects of liberal policies.

💠Strong Leadership Style : Supporters appreciate Trump’s assertive leadership style, viewing it as decisive and effective. They often see him as a non-traditional candidate who can challenge the status quo of politics.

⚜️Media and Political Establishment Resistance : Many voters feel that Trump stands against what they perceive as a biased media and political establishment. This anti-establishment sentiment can resonate strongly with those who feel marginalized by traditional political norms.

💠Public Safety and Law Enforcement : Trump’s tough stance on crime and support for law enforcement appeals to voters concerned about rising crime rates and public safety.

⚜️Energy Independence : His administration emphasized energy independence, advocating for the use of domestic resources. Supporters argue that this leads to lower energy prices and a stronger economy.

💠Focus on Domestic Jobs : Emphasizing job creation in the U.S., Trump supporters believe that his policies can lead to a resurgence in manufacturing and other sectors, ensuring more jobs for American workers.

⚜️Veterans and Military Support : Trump has been vocal in supporting veterans and the military, proposing measures aimed at improving benefits and care for those who serve the country.

🌟Ultimately, support for @realDonaldTrump in the 2024 elections depends on an individual's values, priorities, and beliefs about the direction they want for the country. Each of these points may resonate differently with various voters based on their personal experiences and perspectives.✨💫
