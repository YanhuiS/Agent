Americans are suffering financially thanks to inflation. Food, energy, and mortgage rates are all higher than they were just a few years ago. Who or what is to blame? Donald Trump’s 2017 tax cuts like team Kamala claims, or is it all thanks to Bidenomics? Part 3 of ‘Election Facts for the Undecided Voter’ explores everything about each candidates’ position on the economy: IS one party to blame for our financial crisis? What did Trump and Kamala both do for YOUR financial situation when they were previously in the White House? And who will have the policies in place to help turn it all around next year?

2. Sajith Premadasa's ☎️campaign raised over 1 Billion rupees through ""ticket sales among SJB members."" However, there are no details provided on the actual source of the funds—only on the party operatives who obtained the tickets.

3. The NPP's 🧭 report is over 1,600 pages long, providing detailed expenses, sources of funds, and contributors' names and amounts, as stipulated by the act.

4. Ranil Wickremesinghe’s report is just two pages, lacking any detailed breakdown of expenses or contributions, contrary to the requirements of the act.

""And this is the part where it seems rather incredible to me to support Kamala Harris as somebody who has a vision of a functional world order. 
Trump and Harris are sort of photo negatives of one another in the sense that Trump and his foreign policy actually is rather serious. 
And Kamala Harris appears to sometimes when she's not word salad and say serious things, and then her foreign policy is deeply unserious. 
You may have such an intelligence crisis, in fact, that the Israeli government stops sharing intelligence with the United States specifically because every time they do, it seems to be leaked to the front pages of The New York Times. You could have a foreign policy that is so deeply in hock to America's enemies that in the middle of an existential war in which Israel, for example, is fighting seven different border wars from seven different sources, you have the Biden-Harris administration slow walking aid, threatening a cut off in aid for supposedly humanitarian reasons, all while Kamala Harris seems signally unable to, for example, have a Sister Souljah moment with pro-Hamas supporters in her own party.
And then I'm supposed to feel that that Donald Trump is the threat to world order in. The reality is that Ukraine was invaded under Kamala Harris and Joe Biden was not invaded under Donald Trump. Donald Trump. 
Here's a thing about foreign policy that's really funny. Foreign policy is widely perceived as a is a game of nuance and complexity when in reality, foreign policy is not all that complex and not all that nuanced.
Very often it amounts to if you cross this line, I'll punch you in the face or I'll support people who do. 
And that actually is something that Donald Trump understood quite well, which is why he was able to achieve the best record in the Middle East of any president in my lifetime. While these pseudo sophistication of the Biden-Harris administration has achieved the most massive conflagration in the Middle East in my lifetime.""

Pennsylvania is one of the key swing state in the election where the race is extremely tight and it’s also Amish country.  They traditionally never vote because they want nothing to do with government, so you know the country is in bad shape for them to go out and vote and they are voting Trump. There are 90,000 Amish in Pennsylvania and in 2020 Biden “won” the state by 80,000 votes, so their vote can make the difference.

One week before Election Day, a new analysis from the Media Research Center finds that broadcast evening news coverage of the 2024 presidential race has been the most lopsided in history. Since July, ABC, CBS and NBC have treated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris to 78 percent positive coverage, while these same networks have pummeled former Republican President Donald Trump with 85 percent negative coverage. (See Methodology explanation at the end of this post.)

The difference in coverage between the two candidates is far greater than in 2016, when both Trump and then-challenger Hillary Clinton received mostly negative coverage (91% negative for Trump, vs. 79% negative for Clinton). It’s even greater than in 2020, when Joe Biden was treated to 66 percent positive coverage, vs. 92 percent negative for Trump.

The main reason for the imbalance: Since July, the Big Three have swamped their audiences with more than 230 minutes of airtime — virtually all of it negative — about an array of personal controversies surrounding the former President, yet provided extremely light coverage or altogether ignored many controversies involving Vice President Harris. Instead, Harris’s coverage has been larded with enthusiastic quotes from pro-Harris voters, creating a positive “vibe” for the Democrat even as network reporters criticize Trump themselves.

For this report, MRC analysts reviewed all 660 stories about the presidential campaign that aired on the ABC, CBS or NBC evening newscasts from July 21 (the day President Biden ended his candidacy) through October 25, including weekends. Total coverage added up to 24 hours, 15 minutes, almost evenly divided among the three networks: 8 hours, 20 minutes on NBC; 8 hours, 13 minutes on CBS; and 7 hours, 42 minutes on ABC). Details:

■ Zeroing in on Trump: Three months ago, the networks seemingly couldn’t get enough of Kamala Harris, giving her rock-star coverage after she succeeded President Biden as the 2024 Democratic nominee. But following the September 10 presidential debate, the networks shifted attention away from Harris, spending significantly more airtime targeting Trump.

From the date Harris entered the race on July 21 through September 10, she received 353 minutes of network evening news coverage, virtually identical to the 355 minutes given Trump during the same period. Since then, however, TV has focused nearly twice as much attention on Trump as Harris: 398 minutes for the former President, compared to just 230 minutes for the Vice President.

The additional airtime for Trump was hardly meant as a gift. Instead, it reflected the networks’ intensive focus on Trump controversies, providing opportunities for negative news coverage.

■ Flooding the zone with Trump controversies: Much as they did in 2016, 2020, and throughout his presidency, the networks anointed themselves as the Trump Police, scolding and correcting the former President whenever they decided he’d crossed one of their lines.

Of the 753 minutes of evening news airtime devoted to Trump since July 21, nearly one-third (230 minutes, or 31%) has been about personal controversies. This compares to barely five percent of Harris’s airtime (28 minutes, out of a total 583 minutes of coverage) spent on similar topics.

The list of top controversies reflects liberals’ main talking points against Trump. Garnering the most airtime: the January 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol, including Trump’s insistence that the 2020 election was rigged (47 minutes). Another 30 minutes was spent amplifying claims that Trump is a “danger to democracy” and/or a “fascist” who would use the military to persecute his opponents.

The Big Three spent 18 minutes criticizing Trump for disseminating supposed misinformation about the Biden administration’s response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton; 15 minutes pounding Trump for saying some immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating pets; plus an additional 13 minutes floating concerns about Trump’s age and fitness for another term as President. On each one of these topics, the networks hammered Trump with coverage ranging from 97 to 100 percent negative.

Harris faced no such onslaught. Over fourteen weeks, evening news viewers heard a scant 5 minutes, 22 seconds of GOP criticisms that she’s too liberal, barely one-sixth the airtime spent on the claim Trump is a “fascist.” None of this coverage included any criticisms of Harris from either network reporters or nonpartisan sources.

In July and August, the networks spent 7 minutes, 8 seconds thrilling over the prospect that Harris would make history as the first woman President. But in October, as polls began to trend in Trump’s direction, the networks spent 3 minutes, 5 seconds worrying that voters might be reluctant to choose Harris because of her gender.

Some anti-Harris topics have been completely ignored. MRC’s Geoffrey Dickens detailed five stories — including questions about whether portions of Harris’s 2009 book were plagiarized, her continued advocacy for taxpayer funding for sex reassignment surgery for prison inmates, and the story that her husband, Doug Emhoff, may have hit his girlfriend in the face while in France in 2012. None have been mentioned on any of the Big Three evening newscasts during our study period.

He is ahead in MI and NV, but NV is prone to serious election abuses that started decades ago.  MI is unique in that the Muslim community just endorsed Trump over Harris, and the unions are heavily favoring Trump.  He is ahead, and some pollsters predict a 7 swing state sweep for Trump.  The point is that Harris is down in all seven swing states in polls that skew for Democrats, and she would need to win PA, MI, and WI to have a chance of becoming president.  Democrat voters may not vote for Trump, but the enthusiasm to vote for Harris is non-existent.  I've seen polls that had 7% more Democrat voters than Republicans, and they still showed Trump up by 2%.

Ruben Gallego thinks it'll always be weird for Donald Trump to attack him onstage at rallies

He grew up poor and now a former president calls him names

Of course, Ruben knows Trump is doing it to try to win AZ, especially after losing in 2020

Donald Trump’s chances aren't good - He’s a performer using the same old tired material without any enthusiasm 

He knows he must defeat Ruben to defeat Kamala Harris and that's just not happening according to experts

Will you make a rushed donation to elect @RubenGallego, Senator of Arizona, hold the Senate majority, and of course defeat Donald Trump and Kari Lake

https://t.co/UWbHbPsLSg

Donations are essential to Ruben winning in the days ahead

Thank you for helping to win Arizona for the people","Tue Oct 29 20:13:14 +0000 2024"

Progressives are prepping for a Trump win like Californians prep for “the big one”—stockpiling supplies, hosting safety training, and organizing Women’s Marches.

Some democrats predict a national mental health crisis, workplace confrontations, potentially violent protests, and even “fights at kids’ birthday parties.

In a report from WSJ over 200 activists joined a virtual “Mass Training For Women’s Safety Teams” to prepare for potential confrontations post-election, while others are packing abortion medication to mail to women in states with strict reproductive laws.

Some progressive leaders fear an unprecedented mental health crisis, foreseeing trauma in workplaces, higher rates of alcoholism, and even broken marriages if Trump secures a second term.

CNN could have responded by punishing no one, which would be the best option. Or, they could have banned both from appearing again given both of their respective comments. Instead, they only banned Girdusky. 

Girdusky's beeper comment, if unprompted, would have been too far. But given he was retaliating against someone who called him a Nazi, it was totally fair game. And yet only he is punished with a ban. Mehdi got an apology and asked to appear again.

""Don't vote for evil Trump - vote for the good guys.""

However, you can't be the party of ""good people"" when you yourself exhibit bad morals.

Lying about things Trump said which have unequivocally been proven false - ""fine people"" as an example.

Or outright lying about damning evidence such as the Hunter Biden Laptop.

Or violating the 1st amendment by suppressing political discourse on social media that they didn't like.

Or massively disrupting small communities throughout the country due to unsustainable illegal immigration, deprioritizing US citizens that have often been abused by the system.

One starts to question what exactly the Democrats are the party of.

Therefore, one shouldn't be surprised that there's been a flight away from the Democrat party, which has historically had an advantage in registered voters.

For the first time in at least 30 years, Republicans now have the advantage.

As can be seen in the chart on the upper left, Democrat's party affiliation advantage is now minus 7 - historically in every election since 1992, Democrats have had a significant advantage in affiliation.

This has led the party to consistently win the popular vote.

I wouldn't be surprised if that changes in 2024, which translates to a massive Republican victory.","Tue Oct 29 16:39:08 +0000 2024"

Why do I believe that?

There’s a reason Trump has emphasized to his supporters to vote early.
It’s paying off because the Republicans are doing far better than they ever have and are actually ahead in some key states.
The democrats can’t overcome this big of a lead.

Trump knows the enemies plans.

How do you disarm them?

They need a close election to claim fraud and Russian interference.
They need a close election to delay declaring Trump the winner.
They need a close election to refuse to certify the election.
They also need a close election to prevent Trump’s inauguration.

All of that gets removed if Trump wins in a landslide.

A landslide will expose all of their attempts to prevent Trump taking office as a real “insurrection” and just might be the trigger for military action.","Tue Oct 29 14:55:18 +0000 2024"

CNN's Harry Enten warned viewers, “Part of my job is to warn our viewers, on either side of the aisle, of an event that may occur, that they don’t necessarily like, and Donald Trump winning the popular vote could ABSOLUTELY happen.”

Knowing liberal heads would explode, Enten told viewers to prepare for that reality now, saying, “You might as well wrap your minds around it now folks if you don’t like Donald Trump.”","Tue Oct 29 15:49:45 +0000 2024"

My gut is telling me now that Harris is pulling out of NC and likely soon the Sun Belt altogether that her only scenario is to hold all three of PA, MI, WI to win 270-268, and rely on sabotage of the mail and in-person suppression to do it.

Went to my car this morning to check how many Trump signs I've got left and noticed my driveway was blocked by another car. 😠 

This happens all too frequently because I live near an elementary school.

I honestly was a little irked waiting for the person to come back and move their car so I could get out of my driveway. 

Dude walks over to his car, opens his door, and I say, ""Yo, good morning.""

He looks up at the Trump sign on top of my 6 foot fence and says, ""Yeah, Trump.""

I asked him if he's voting for Trump, and he said, ""Yes,"" and I asked if he wanted a Trump sign.

We chatted for a few minutes, I gave him two signs, and he told me he's going to put them  in front of his house a couple blocks away. 

Keep in mind that I live in a very blue zone in inner city Wilmington. 

What could have been a confrontation about a blocked driveway turned into an opportunity. 

Granted, our Delaware votes are essentially meaningless in the presidential election, but it was an opportunity to talk about policy with a constituency often ignored in GOP politics in Delaware:

The black male voter. 

Even though voter registration is over, we still have the opportunity to talk about policy to everyone willing to listen and learn. 

Go forth today and close the deal.

Secure promises to vote for Trump/Vance and the dream transition team America needs to survive!

Let's roll people. 🇺🇸 

LEAVE NO VOTER BEHIND!

Let his leadership be marked by peace through strength, a resolve that unites rather than divides, that builds rather than destroys. As he guides America, may he become an agent of peace, fortifying bonds with Israel and creating pathways toward reconciliation with nations like Iran, where countless souls yearn for freedom.

At the sacred Western Wall, women stand in prayer, hands pressed to ancient stones, asking for redemption and healing for the land. Let their voices carry the hope of peace in Jerusalem, in America, and across the Middle East.

Bless Israel, that it may flourish in safety and prosperity, and grant America a future of righteousness. As allies, may they bring forth the light of Your teachings and act as pillars of hope for all nations. Through Trump’s leadership, may they embody strength as a pathway to peace.

Lord of all, grant that his victory be a stepping stone toward unity, that he may lead with wisdom, strength, and a commitment to Your divine plan. May he inspire cooperation and mutual respect, fostering a world where nations rise together, lifted by Your hand.

With steadfast hope and faith in Your wisdom, we say: Amen.

“Please explain to all of us Orthodox Jewish Trump supporters (the vast majority of Orthodox Jews) how it’s a ‘Nazi rally,’” wrote journalist Yaakov Strasberg on X.

MSNBC's Jonathan Capehart compared footage from Trump’s rally to a 1939 Nazi event at Madison Square Garden, sparking outrage. Jewish Trump supporters, including public figures, condemned the comparison, accusing MSNBC of disrespecting Holocaust memory. Breitbart News fact-checked these claims, noting Madison Square Garden has also hosted anti-Nazi events.","Tue Oct 29 09:22:02 +0000 2024"

In response, Republican operative Ryan Gidursky fired back, “Hope your beeper doesn’t go off.”

Hasan’s Nazi remark was inflammatory; Gidursky’s beeper comment was inappropriate. 

This exchange is also the exact rhetorical trap Mehdi has set up again and again: provoking opponents into responses he can then exploit as bigotry. Gidursky walked into Mehdi’s trap and resuscitated the TV provocateur’s career. 

Americans must sidestep these baited conflicts and stand firmly for higher values without getting mired in divisive tactics. 

In 2015, Mehdi arrived in the United States from the United Kingdom as an apologist for Islamist regimes like Qatar, his former boss, and Iran. He doesn’t actually have higher values. As Muslim reformers, we know his type very well. That’s why I devote pages in my book WOKE ARMY to Mehdi. He is a propagandist for Islamist tyrants who are anti-woman, anti-gay, anti-freedom. It’s easy to win an argument with him because he has a losing argument.

In 2016, Hasan positioned himself as a constant critic of Donald Trump and acquired a host seat at MSNBC in 2021. He lost that job in 2024 with his rants against Israel. He is Qatar propaganda 24/7.

Mehdi literally wrote a book titled, “Win Every Argument,” and uses tactics that bait critics into his trap. 

I’ve seen it firsthand—at an Islamic Society of North America convention in Houston, I watched him tee up his training on combatting “Islamophobia,” teaching participants how to quickly allege bigotry. 

Americans need to stay clear of these traps. 

The way forward? 

Straight forward arguments, not mud slinging. And an appeal to higher values.

Remember this non-halal saying: “Never wrestle with a pig; you both get dirty.” 

The best way to “win every argument” every time: uphold higher values.","Tue Oct 29 07:13:07 +0000 2024"
