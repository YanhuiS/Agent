Will Democrats Accept the Results of the 2024 Presidential Election?
#Election2024 #VOTE #DemocratsCheat 
An army of lawyers from both sides is being deployed across the nation in anticipation of massive voter fraud, similar to what went on during the 2020 election.

While Republicans are out there to identify and prevent the fraud, Democrats are obfuscating and concealing their efforts to count ballots multiple times, stop the rejection of invalid ballots, and keep objective observers from reporting on the mishandling of ballots by those intent on committing election fraud. Democrats are actually working to allow non-citizens to vote.

So-called fact-checkers point out that this only applies to local and state elections, not federal elections.

Don’t fall for this misdirection. Why have Democrats, from Joe Biden on down, pushed so hard to allow non-citizens to vote? Once voting by non-citizens in local and state elections is legitimized, America as we have known it for more than 240 years will no longer exist.","Sat Oct 26 23:54:53 +0000 2024"

As we approach the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election, astrologers from around the world are diving deep into celestial alignments, and the majority are coming up with a forecast that may surprise some: a win for Kamala Harris. Why are so many astrologers placing their bets on the current Vice President? 

The reasons are fascinating, rooted in both ancient techniques and planetary configurations that reflect our times. Here’s a breakdown of the main astrological reasons supporting their uniquely derived prediction. 🔮

🔹 Zodiacal Releasing Peaks for Harris
Astrologers like Leisa Schaim are using a technique known as Zodiacal Releasing, which pinpoints major periods of activity in one’s life. Harris, entering a significant “peak period” in her chart extending into 2028, is in a cosmic phase where public success and influence are highly likely. This timing hints at career-defining achievements, aligning well with the idea of securing the presidency.

🔹 Saturn in Pisces and the Power of Continuity
One of the most compelling arguments comes from astrologers like SJ Anderson, who note that every time Saturn has been in Pisces during past elections, the incumbent party has held onto power. Saturn in Pisces, symbolizing stability and continuity, creates a strong case for the Democrats to retain control, aligning the planets favorably with Harris’s candidacy.

🔹 Feminine Planetary Power: The Moon and Venus Out of Bounds

Astrologers are also pointing to a rare phenomenon on election day where the Moon and Venus—symbols of feminine influence—are “out of bounds,” a term that suggests unconventional power. Christine Arens and Julija Simas emphasize how these planets, associated with feminine energy, reflect the rise of a prominent female leader. Kamala Harris, as the sole female candidate, could align with this energy, making her chart a strong contender against Trump’s.

🔹 Key Asteroids Like Ceres and Pallas Athena on Harris’s Side

Celestial influences extend beyond planets alone; feminine-themed asteroids like Ceres and Pallas Athena are highly active in Harris’s chart this season. Ceres, symbolizing care and nurture, suggests societal shifts toward these values, possibly favoring a Harris presidency. Paired with Pallas Athena’s symbolism of wisdom and strategy, astrologers like Louise Edington see a unique alignment of female empowerment themes supporting Harris’s path.

🔹 Favorable Transits and Progressions for Harris

Several astrologers, including Maurice Fernandez and Kimberly McGrath, highlight that Harris’s planetary transits are bolstered by favorable aspects involving Jupiter and Venus—traditionally associated with public support and career success. Meanwhile, Trump’s chart is undergoing challenging transits from Pluto and Saturn, potentially mirroring the legal struggles he faces. These obstacles, astrologers argue, could weigh heavily on his campaign.

🔹 A Harmonized Rahu Dasha for Harris

Vedic astrologers bring another layer of insight, with Komilla Sutton noting how the U.S. is in a Rahu-Mercury planetary period that complements Harris’s current Rahu-Venus period. This synchronization could give her an edge, aligning her personal planetary timing with that of the nation itself. Trump, on the other hand, faces a less compatible dasha, indicating a mismatch with the country’s energetic flow.

🔹 The Jupiter-Saturn Cycle of Change and Renewal

Astrologers like Dan Waites and Karen Christino explore the Jupiter-Saturn synodic cycle, which has historically brought forward progressive new leaders and shifts in political structures. Harris, representing a newer wave of governance, is seen as aligning well with this cosmic cycle of renewal, while Trump’s vision represents an older guard. This shift in energy could favor her campaign.

🔹 Major Societal Shifts in Outer Planet Transits

2024 marks a time when several outer planets are nearing new sign placements, which often signal societal evolution. As Neptune and Uranus edge toward new signs, astrologers interpret this as an era of transformation, possibly embodied by Harris’s progressive platform and appeal. Astrologers like Julija Simas say this backdrop of change makes her candidacy resonate with society's evolving social and cultural needs.

✨ In Summary

The stars and planets tell a fascinating story, and astrologers are attuned to these patterns as they make their predictions. From historical cycles to modern techniques, most astrologers agree that 2024’s election could reflect the winds of change favoring Kamala Harris. Yet, the road to November 5—and beyond—is far from simple. 

With charged astrological aspects on key dates like December 17 and January 6, astrologers anticipate that post-election proceedings could bring both turbulence and transformation.

Astrology offers us a symbolic lens through which we can see the world’s rhythms and cycles, and Harris’s prediction this year is a testament to that wisdom. Whether this forecast will come true remains to be seen, but it has certainly sparked excitement and curiosity about how cosmic forces might shape this pivotal moment in history. 🌠

As of now, these reports remain unconfirmed by official channels from Trump or Kennedy's teams.

However, the mere discussion of such an event underscores the deep rifts in American politics concerning health policy, government oversight, and the influence of private entities in public sectors.

The coming months will reveal whether these plans are indeed set in motion or if they remain the speculative buzz of political discourse.

The story continues to develop, with many watching closely to see how truth aligns with the allegations spreading across social media and alternative news outlets.","Sat Oct 26 23:48:45 +0000 2024"

Trump was basically a continuation of Obama's policies when it came to foreign policy. 

Magatards claim ""we we're at peace"" during his term 😅
While wars were still going on all throughout the middle east and in Africa during his presidency.  

""He made peace treaties in the middle east"" Not even close. Those ""peace treaties"" we're really arms deals and bribes when you actually dig into them.   

- In his campaign he blamed the Saudis for 9/11. Then he sold the Saudi regime billions in weapons. Weapons used in Yemen. (Worst humanitarian crisis in the world during that time) No new 9/11 investigation like he stated in his campaign.       

- Gave the UAE billions in arms.       

-  Armed al Qaeda against the Houthis.       

- Vetoed the resolution to end US involvement in Yemen.        

- Bipartisan with Democrats to increase/extend Patriot Act spying powers.       

- Signed off on FISA warrantless surveillance.       

- Escalated tensions with Iran. Assassinated General Soleimani. Including the deputy chairman of Iraq's PMF. Flirting with a new war. Soleimani played a large role in the defeat of ISIS. The hit was to satisfy the Israelis.       

- Sent arms to Ukraine, arms that even Obama wouldn't send to Ukraine. 

- Expanded NATO twice.       

- Recently helped orchestrate the passage of the $100 Billion War Funding Bill (For Ukraine/Israel)    

- Increased military spending.       

- Bombed Syria.       

- He planned to pull out of Syria. After saying we are there ""Only for the oil""  He brought in Douglas McGregor during the lame duck session, who convinced him to pull out of Syria. He reversed course once the neocons in his administration got in the room with him. We are still there illegally occupying Syrian oil fields.   

- His administration like Obama's armed the Syrian rebels.  

- Supported regime change in Syria, a continuation of Obama's policies. Went along with the propaganda Assad gas attacks.       

- Helped Israel steal the Golan Heights from Syria, creating more war like tensions in the region.       

- He supported CIA regime change coup in Venezuela. Pushing CIA propaganda talking points, propping up CIA asset Guaido.       

- Supported military regime change coups in Nicaragua and in Bolivia.       

- Allowed Pompeo banning the international criminal court investigators from talking about U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan.       

- Handed over the State Department to Mike Pompeo.

- Appointed war hawk Steve Bannon as Chief Strategist.       

- Brought in Zionist Sigsl Mandelker, to be Secretary of the Treasury/Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.  She directed the economic war on Iran. Escalating tensions.  Fun fact, Mandelker was involved in brokering the infamous Florida deal that allowed sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein to avoid federal charges.       

- He also increasingly provocation U.S. naval patrols in South China sea. Stationed thousands of more troops in the region. Stationed US troops in Taiwan.       

- Backed out of the INF nuclear treaty.       

- Drone strikes went to an all time high.       

- Trump administration revoked a policy requiring US intelligence officials to publish the number of civilians deaths killed in drone strikes outside of war zones.       

- 330% civilian casualty increase in Afghanistan.       

- Ramped up drone strikes throughout Africa.     

- Dropped more bombs in 4 years than Obama in 8. (73K worth of bomb)       

-Dropping the largest non-nuclear bomb ever.       

-installed a Raytheon Lobbyist as his Defense Secretary.       

- Iraqi government voted to expel US forces from the country. Perfect opportunity for him to exit that war. Trump threatens sanctions on Iraq instead...       

- Gave Israel absolutely everything they wanted in the region. Creating tension in the region.
I remember him saying ""Israel literally owned Congress ten years ago and rightfully so""   
He's will continue to support Israel's foreign policy throughout the middle east. He won't go against his $100M donor Miriam Adelson.  

- Brags about the ""historic Abraham Accords"" so called peace deal. That wasn't an actual peace deal.  Just bribes and arms deals to countries that weren't at war with each other, to look the other way on Israel. 

- His own administration (Pompeo/Barr) went after Assange with new charges and conspired to have him murdered.  Assange is praised for bringing to light America's war-crimes throughout the middle east.    

- During his last administration he endorsed every RINO.  

""But it will be different this time"" People say.  
As he continues to side with neocon war hawks.

He is considering Tom Cotton, Mike Pompeo, and Mike Waltz for Secretary of Defense...  3 neocons. 
He props up Marco Rubio, Nikki Haley, Elliot Abrams, Lindsey Graham, Mike Johnson.

Jared Kushner is a part of his team. 

Backed by Peter Thiel and Miriam Adelson & others. 

props up ""deep state actors"" like Boris Johnson and Netanyahu. 
  
He repeats what the war hawks in DC tell him.
""Iran is trying to kill me"" Now he wants to bomb Iran. 

Trump bends the knee to the warmongering War-hawks in DC and foreign donors. He does what he's told, just like Biden/Kamala.","Sat Oct 26 23:47:53 +0000 2024"

In a whirlwind of revelations following Donald Trump's possible re-election, the nation is rocked by disclosures that challenge long-held beliefs about some of America's most infamous tragedies.

Martin Luther King Jr. and the Unsolved Mystery

Upon his return to the White House, Trump will initiate a series of declassifications, one of which pertains to the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. According to newly released files, King's death was not solely the work of James Earl Ray but involved a conspiracy reaching into the heart of the U.S. government. Trump, in a televised address, stated, ""The truth about Dr. King's assassination has been hidden for too long. It's time the American people know who really took him out.""

The documents suggest that elements within the FBI, under the direction of J. Edgar Hoover, played a significant role in orchestrating or at least facilitating the assassination due to King's growing influence and his potential to disrupt the status quo. However, Trump's revelations have sparked a nationwide debate, with many calling for further investigation into these claims.

Trump's Revelation on Epstein and JFK

In another bombshell, Trump addressed the long-standing mysteries surrounding the deaths of Jeffrey Epstein and John F. Kennedy. In what many describe as a move to clear his name from conspiracy theories, Trump revealed that Epstein's death was indeed not a suicide but a murder, carried out by individuals with motives tied to international espionage and blackmail. ""Epstein knew too much, and his death was a cleanup operation,"" Trump declared, though he stopped short of naming specific culprits.

Regarding JFK; Trump disclosed that new evidence points to a broader conspiracy involving not only Lee Harvey Oswald but also elements from both domestic and foreign intelligence communities. ""The truth about JFK's assassination is more complex than we've been led to believe,"" Trump said, hinting at upcoming releases that could potentially expose the names involved.

Public Reaction and Political Fallout;

These revelations have sent shockwaves through the political landscape, with calls for immediate investigations, resignations, and even threats of legal action against those involved. Critics argue Trump's timing and selective disclosure could be politically motivated, aiming to solidify his base by fulfilling decades-old conspiracy theories.

As the nation grapples with these revelations, the demand for transparency has never been higher. Trump's strategy, whether seen as a bold move for truth or a controversial manipulation of history, has undeniably set the stage for a tumultuous term in office, where the past might just alter the future. 

The full implications of these disclosures are yet to unfold, but one thing is clear: the truth, as they say, has a way of coming to light, and in this case, it's shining a harsh spotlight on America's darkest corners.","Sat Oct 26 12:33:56 +0000 2024"

Industry supporters contend that Republican lawmakers will hesitate to go along with Trump’s attempt to liquidate IRA, noting the tax credits have spurred investment and created jobs in their districts.

Michael Catanzaro, a former White House special assistant to Trump and president of Republican lobbying shop CGCN Group, disputes that notion.

“Let me address a canard that is often spoken here in Washington, which is that a lot of the investment under IRA is being done in red states and red districts,” he told a recent webinar held by law firm Norton Rose Fulbright.
He argued that while there are a lot of announced projects around the country, which is great, “An announced project is not a built project.”

Part of the reason there are only announced projects in many places is the “permitting process is such a disaster,” he said, blaming permitting delays on a plethora of new rules, regulations and other guidance issued by the Biden administration.
“Just because you have projects being announced in red states does not mean that Republicans will have a hard time repealing large parts of the IRA,” he added.

John Gimigliano, principal-in-charge of federal legislative and regulatory services for KPMG in Washington, noted on the webinar that Trump and Republicans want to extend 2017 federal tax cuts for businesses and individuals that were enacted in his term and expire next year.

He agrees it is a ""false hope to assume that the number of potential investments in Republican states will act as a firewall against repeal.""

Gimigliano added: ""There may be some reluctance, but remember that you are forcing Republicans to decide between raising taxes on millions of individuals, including middle-income folks, and repealing incentives for a handful of energy projects in their states or districts.""

The US Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, which is comprised of five lawmakers from the Senate Finance Committee and five from the House Ways and Means Committee, estimates extending the 2017 tax cuts will cost $4.3trn.
Trump sees axing IRA tax breaks and other spending as helping pay the cost of a tax cut extension.

Still, enough Republican lawmakers favour IRA tax credits for carbon capture and hydrogen development, critical minerals mining and processing, and re-shoring of manufacturing especially from China.

This makes it unlikely these and other incentives will be scrapped by Congress.","Sat Oct 26 23:48:50 +0000 2024"

The news has sparked a mix of reactions across the political spectrum:

Supporters of Trump and Kennedy see this as a necessary step to cleanse government corruption and hold those in power accountable for what they believe to be mismanagement or worse during the health crisis.

Critics argue that such moves are not only politically motivated but could dangerously undermine trust in public health initiatives. 

They warn of the potential for these actions to foster conspiracy theories and further polarize the nation.

Legal and Ethical Concerns have been raised about the feasibility and propriety of such arrests. 

Legal experts debate whether there exists sufficient legal ground for these actions or if they would represent an overreach of presidential power.

Implications
If these plans indeed come to fruition, January 20, 2025, could mark a historic moment in U.S. political history, potentially leading to significant legal battles, a reevaluation of public health governance, and an unprecedented shift in how health policy is crafted in America.","Sat Oct 26 23:47:02 +0000 2024"

He might assert unilateral authority over executive actions, dismiss checks and balances from Congress and the judiciary, and pursue controversial initiatives without regard for bipartisan support or public opinion. 

This could manifest in aggressive moves to reshape domestic and foreign policy, expand executive power, and limit media scrutiny. Concerns about democratic norms, civil liberties, and institutional integrity could rise sharply, as Trump's administration might prioritize loyalty over merit and dismiss dissenting voices within the government and beyond. The implications for the rule of law, accountability, and the balance of power could be profound, creating a polarized environment with increased tensions among various branches of government and the public.","Sat Oct 26 23:27:11 +0000 2024"

With the presidential election underway, the issue at hand is not AI's potential— which is enormous—but its governance. The oversight by the Federal Election Commission to refrain from enacting new regulations on AI usage in this critical democratic process carries profound implications.

Let us pivot our focus to the unsettling incidents of disinformation already surfacing: a computer-generated image of Taylor Swift endorsing former President Donald Trump stirred up controversy, necessitating a clarification from the pop icon herself. Furthermore, a fabricated video of Vice President Kamala Harris' voice disseminated by entrepreneur Elon Musk adds layers of complexity to political discourse. By extending beyond mere digital trickery, these instances violate public trust and the essence of free and fair elections.

The modus operandi of external forces, like Russia and Iran, has been to weaponize AI against the electoral process. OpenAI's discovery of these antagonistic efforts reaffirms the need for vigilance. It is not hyperbole to state that the future of democracy could hinge on our ability to effectively audit and regulate the use of AI.

We must delve into discussions of how AI will continue to shape not only this election but many to come. It is imperative to unravel the tapestry of legal, ethical, and social threads that will define our societal landscape. Revisiting the founding fathers' intention of a government ""by the people, for the people,"" one questions—can we keep this ethos intact amidst the digital renaissance, or will we witness its unraveling at the hands of unregulated AI?

As constituents and consumers of media, our responsibility is heightened. Supporting platforms like NPR's 1A not only fosters informed conversations but also sustains a sphere where questions, facts, and enlightenment reign over AI-generated confusion. Engagement and education become the bulwarks against manipulative AI practices. We are encouraged to connect, inquire, and even lend our voices by contributing to public radio stations or subscribing ad-free to further this mission.

The crux of this discourse is not to stifle innovation but to ensure technology serves democracy's loftiest goals. As we stride into the digital age's political arena, let us be guided by a compass that points steadfastly towards integrity and transparency. This election shall serve as a crucible, testing our collective will to maintain the democratic sanctity in the face of AI's seductive power. Can we keep it? This question beckons a deeper reflection not merely on policy but on our enduring commitment to liberty and truth.","Sat Oct 26 21:32:08 +0000 2024"

There's no widespread policy or legal framework in the U.S. allowing schools to perform or initiate transgender ""operations"" or any gender-affirming treatments on minors without parental consent. Such treatments, especially surgeries, are not casually decided upon or performed on minors; they require extensive psychological evaluation, consent from parents, and in many cases, court approval due to the complexity and ethical considerations involved. Trump's assertion plays into fears by implying a loss of parental rights, which ignores the legal and ethical standards in place. Moreover, it contributes to a climate of fear and misinformation around transgender healthcare, which is typically approached with caution, involving therapy, and often, reversible treatments like puberty blockers before any permanent changes are considered. This narrative not only misrepresents the reality of transgender healthcare practices but also undermines the rights and well-being of transgender youth, suggesting a level of intervention by schools that simply does not exist in policy or practice.","Sat Oct 26 23:18:03 +0000 2024"

Tax cuts for businesses? Check. Deregulation? Double check. These aren't just campaign promises; they've been action items that, love them or loathe them, have reshaped economic landscapes. Critics might call it reckless, but supporters see it as the equivalent of giving the economy an adrenaline shot.

Foreign Policy: Trump's approach has been as subtle as a sledgehammer in a tea shop. His 'America First' mantra wasn't just a slogan; it's been a guiding principle for trade deals, NATO contributions, and even how he reshuffles the international alliances deck. Sure, it's ruffled feathers, but it's also started conversations about global responsibilities.

Immigration: Here's where the policy gets spicy. Trump's policies on immigration have been as clear-cut as a meat cleaver. Build a wall? He tried, and even if it didn't span coast to coast, it was a statement of intent. Policies like 'Remain in Mexico' and the reduction of refugee caps? They might lack the finesse of a diplomat's touch, but they've certainly put the focus on border","Sat Oct 26 23:16:06 +0000 2024"
