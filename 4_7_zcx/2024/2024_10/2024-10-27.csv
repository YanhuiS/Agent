""And that's one of the reasons they spent the last four years trying to destroy the country because they're mad at its voters for liking Donald Trump.""

""The first reason that people like Donald Trump is because he likes them. That's why. And it's real affection is something you can't fake. I don't care how many times Kamala Harris would tell me she loves me, I don't believe her.""

As promised here are the Reference Sheets that you can use for Nov 5 to gauge how things are going. Please note that this is in the perspective of Trump's performance, so if you don't want him to win then just look for the opposite of what is stated :)

The first one is a document that is just for people who do not want maps, you can just go off of this as you are watching the results come in. 

The maps with counties, including highlighting around the counties so you can find them easier. It can be hard to find the counties, so I hope this added detail is helpful for your all.

See below for the Legend in order to understand what I am saying in the Reference Sheets (it is included in the first document but not the second). 

I hope this is helpful to you all!

Legend: 

Just County Names: Trump needs to win these outright, switching them from blue to red. These are Bellwethers that go with the winner of the state typically.

County Names with % and Explanations: Indicators that Trump needs to be close to this to be hitting the % margins he needs either at or above the Red % (or the Blue % if stated).

I am not debating who is best between Trump vs Harris. I said in my tweet from hours ago that telling people that Trump is worse does not help Arab American voters who feel KH will continue the Biden policy of allowing Israel to indiscriminately bomb brown babies without consequence.

Arab Americans are intelligent enough to know the difference. That’s not my point. 

I’m not shoring myself in the foot for asking questions about a person I’m voting for. I honestly think you and most people lack the empathy to hold space for views other than your own. 

You lack the capacity not to enrage in dualistic frameworks and simply open your heart to how other people feel. Doing so doesn’t undermine your position; it simply opens your heart to another. *This convo* doesn’t have to be transactional.","Sun Oct 27 10:53:43 +0000 2024"

HOW TRUMP FAILS IN UKRAINE
Trump’s Ukraine policy is akin to a dead man walkin, and he’s too aloof to see it. Trump stated he’ll negotiate a deal… great. Let’s examine.

No matter ‘what’ is negotiated, neither side will accept the conditions.  It’s the same old horse of ‘conditional surrender,’ the same construct that ended the Kosovo and Korean Wars; both that still retain military tensions.  Any conditional ‘cease fire’ would be weaker than Biden’s foreign policy.  Yes, I punch both ways.  

Peace keepers / monitors will be needed.  But who?
- OSCE had monitors in UKR from 2014-2022 with a horrible track record.  Not for lack of effort, rather the diplo/politico OSCE structures.  
- NATO peace keepers work, but putting NATO forces on Russia’s border is a gift Putin NEVER wanted, nor will he accept.  
- If NATO is bad, UN peace keepers are worse. Imagine the shitstorm that ensues when Chinese ‘peace keepers’ get into a Russian/Ukraine border skirmish.   

So…. Trump’s brilliant 5 second sound bite (‘I’ll make a deal’) is utterly void of reality.  The truth is, forcing Ukraine into peace talks really means forcing them into insurgency warfare.  And forcing our European allies to covertly support Ukraine in that effort.  

The war won’t end.  It will merely morph into a different beast.  And as it continues to rage, Trump will look like a ‘loser’ who could not close the deal.  

Put that in your pipe and smoke it, @JDVance.","Sun Oct 27 08:20:27 +0000 2024"

Donald Trump has recently criticized Vice President Kamala Harris, claiming that the Biden-Harris administration's handling of international affairs is leading the U.S. toward World War III. He specifically linked their foreign policy to escalating tensions in the Middle East, particularly Iran's recent missile attacks on Israel, and argued that their actions have emboldened adversaries such as Russia and Iran. Trump has also accused Harris of being weak on foreign policy, asserting that Iran and other opponents prefer her in power due to perceived ineffectiveness.

Meanwhile, former First Lady Michelle Obama has been actively campaigning for Harris in Michigan, focusing on rallying support ahead of the 2024 presidential election. Michigan remains a key battleground state, with Harris trailing Trump slightly in state polls despite gaining a slight edge nationally. Both campaigns are heavily focusing on these crucial swing states in the final weeks leading up to Election Day......","Sun Oct 27 06:17:54 +0000 2024"

From “poisoning the blood”, to “they’re eating the cats, they’re eating the dogs, and now “America is the garbage can of the world”.  Trump never has anything to say about a nation he once represented on a global stage.

What an amazing embarrassment he was for America; he remains so still.

 By framing immigrants as a threat to national security and economic stability, Trump has tapped into deep-seated fears and prejudices within segments of the population. 

His inflammatory language often dehumanizes individuals who come to the U.S. seeking a better life, perpetuating harmful stereotypes that equate immigrants with criminality and danger. 

This rhetoric not only fosters an environment of hostility and fear but also undermines the values of inclusivity and diversity that many Americans hold dear.

The consequences of such rhetoric contributed to a surge in hate crimes and xenophobic attitudes across the country. #MAGA

Communities that have long been vibrant due to their immigrant populations find themselves on the defensive, navigating an increasingly hostile environment. 

In essence, Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric serves not only as a tool for political mobilization but also as a catalyst for broader societal decay. It diminishes our collective humanity and distracts from the real contributions that immigrants make to the fabric of American society. 

Trump literally disqualifies himself everyday he opens his mouth.  America, Trump is unfit for office.

Trump is almost certainly going to lose Virginia, but he doesn't need VA to win this election. First, let me explain why I don't believe Trump can win Virginia: 

There are too many early votes that have already been cast.

Even if we assume record turnout (over 75%, which would match 2020), we're still on track for more than 45% of the total vote to be cast early.

And while it's true that Trump will win the largest percentage of the early vote of any Republican in modern history, he's still going to lose this group.

For example, even if we have him splitting independents and swing voters (who traditionally break for Democrats in ABEV voting), he's still on track to lose the early vote 55-45.

And this is where the real problem for Trump in VA comes into play.

If we assume this generous breakdown in the early vote (which is exceedingly unlikely), AND if we assume a record turnout that breaks even 2020 levels, then Trump would still need to capture 54% of the election day vote to secure a 0.13% margin of victory in VA.

That simply isn't happening.

But now that I've dumped a bunch of cold water on my followers who have been hoping that the daily reports of Virginia getting redder would mean Trump can actually flip VA, let me provide everyone with a whitepill.

The numbers I see in Virginia—while pointing very clearly to a Harris victory here—also seem to spell trouble for her in the rest of the country.

The margins in Virginia are *objectively* moving to the right from 2020. Virginia is almost certainly not going to vote for Trump, but it WILL get redder this year.

Doing some back-of-the-napkin math brings the best case for Harris to around 8.5% in VA, and that's after giving her 2022 margins with early swing voters AND giving her an outright victory on election day in the Commonwealth (two extremely generous assumptions that seem far-fetched considering the current national environment).

Does that mean I'm officially calling VA for Harris by 8.5%? No. My original prediction for Virginia going to Harris by 5-7 has not changed. I'm simply using these figures as placeholders to demonstrate how VA is poised to shift right this year, potentially by several points.

The broader point I'm trying to make is that if Harris only wins VA by 8.5% after making these frankly absurd concessions to her, I cannot see a realistic path for her to win the presidential election. If she needs this much help to get her to 8.5% in VA, I don't see how she possibly wins states like NC, GA, or PA.","Sun Oct 27 19:37:17 +0000 2024"

He is also apparently using the B-word to describe his own daughter Ivanka Trump because she hasn't spent enough time campaigning for him this election cycle.  

Seems as if things are pretty bad in the Trump campaign right now.  I can't believe that Trump appears to once again be relying on the notion that the election is rigged to try and sneak his way back into the most important office on the planet.  

Remember that America's elections are some of the safest on the planet.

(and it's ironically very bullish for all our memecoin bags)

a Trump win is giga bullish for memecoins, and i'm confident that it would fuel one of the most explosive memecoin rallies ever known to man 

for a few reasons:

1. it's gonna get incredibly easy for retail to ape memecoins 

in case you do not get it: 

- bonk is literally the only memecoin Coinbase has listed this cycle
- Robinhood and other top retail trading outlets are yet to list a single memecoin 

why? 

regulatory fears

the US establishment is battling these outlets for listing safer large caps (even refusing to give clarity about Ethereum), so they figured there's no point dabbling into memes until there is clarity 

trust me, these trading outlets do not care about your values and morals

they care about volume and trading fees, however 

and memecoins have consistently delivered that this cycle - and will continue to 

if we get a Trump win and Republican sweep, the floodgates will open to memecoins getting listed on more established platforms 

institutions will more readily list and trade them

there is literally NOT A SINGLE disadvantage for memecoins should we get a Trump win and a Republican sweep

it's literally going to get easier for massive capital to access them on safer platforms, which will pump them harder and create the kind of headlines that suck people into memecoins even more

2. VC grifters will become more emboldened to continue their 'high float, low FDV' scams under a Trump admin

as well as other initiatives that enrich them at the expense of retail

and many of them will try to get away with as much as they can

since there will be more leeway for them and less consequences 

and not a single of their schemes will be designed to benefit retail 

which will only reinforce the need for retail to dabble into memecoins since they are more 'egalitarian'

3. Trump admin will likely introduce the kind of monetary policy that fuels risk on degeneracy and animal spirits

because for Trump, the markets pumping is PERSONAL and a matter of ego 

and he's going to ensure it happens no matter what 

and every risk on asset will benefit 

most especially memecoins

to conclude:

this is literally a MEMECOIN SUPERCYCLE 

and there is no stopping it","Sun Oct 27 17:20:17 +0000 2024"

He is also apparently using the B-word to describe his own daughter Ivanka Trump because she hasn't spent enough time campaigning for him this election cycle.  

Seems as if things are pretty bad in the Trump campaign right now.  I can't believe that Trump appears to once again be relying on the notion that the election is rigged to try and sneak his way back into the most important office on the planet.  

Remember that America's elections are some of the safest on the planet.  

Just like the random text message floating around claiming that Biden thinks Harris is going to lose, this text message could have been sent by anyone on the planet to anyone on the planet and has absolutely no merit what-so-ever.","Sun Oct 27 15:46:18 +0000 2024"

🎉 95% of Betting Odds for Trump to Win - Here's Why It's Monumental 🇺🇸

Imagine if, back in '16, the betting odds were this clear. Would we have seen such a shock? NO! But here we are in 2024, and the numbers don't lie. 95%! That's not just a prediction; it's a PROCLAMATION of what's about to unfold.

🔥 Why is this important? 🔥

The Silent Majority Speaks: That 95% isn't just numbers; it's voices. Voices of Americans from all walks of life, tired of the status quo, yearning for America First policies.
A Landslide in the Making?: We might be on the cusp of witnessing one of the most significant landslides in U.S. history. This isn't just about winning; it's about making history. 
Economic Confidence: Betting markets reflect economic confidence. This level of betting shows faith in Trump's economic policies, suggesting a belief in economic revival and prosperity.
The Power of the People: This isn't about the elite or the media; it's about the REAL people. The ones who've seen their towns revitalized, their jobs returned, and their borders secured under Trump's leadership.
Don't Sleep on This: Remember, elections aren't won with betting odds but with votes. If you're part of the 95%, or even if you're not, your vote is your voice. Let's make those odds a reality.

📢 VOTE! VOTE! VOTE! 📢

Don't let this be just another prediction. Make it a prophecy fulfilled. Get out and vote. Let's show the world that when America decides, it decides big. Let's make this not just a win, but a statement.

What I found fascinating though, was the conversations my costume sparked. Every single person I spoke with thought that Trump will win the election. Actually most said that Harris will lose and Trump wins by default because she's run such a terrible campaign.

The people at the party came from all political backgrounds and it was truly interesting to see how they joined together in their disdain of Harris.

I think that it's a sign of how the political pendulum has swung globally and most certainly does not bode well for Trudeau.

i) Memecoins themselves are a form of economic populism. They are a statement against the unfair ( and often grifty) tokenomics of VC-backed and insider coins. 

ii) But VC-backed coins are a modern phenomenon forced upon us by the toxicity of the Gensler/Warren regime. As are extreme measures like geo-blocked airdrops, VPN blocks, and so on.

iii) A Republican sweep undoes all of that and brings back ICOs, airdrops for all, and other kinds of token sanity. 

iv) A Republican sweep also enables fee switches and token dividends and other economically productive ways to return value to token-holders that memecoins don't have.

Ergo: regulatory sanity in America is bad for memecoins because it refocuses crypto on dApps and other things that actually matter, leading to a prolonged bear market where most people lose money on them.

Not investment advice. Except for the part about people losing money on memecoins. That's definitely investment advice. It's inevitable no matter what happens in the election. Every joke eventually stops being funny.","Sun Oct 27 12:33:10 +0000 2024"
