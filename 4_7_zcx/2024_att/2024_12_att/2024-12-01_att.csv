Accountability, Retribution, Justice, and Complete Exposure are needed! ‚öñÔ∏èüîç

The incoming Trump Administration isn't here to play nice. It's time for a reckoning. We're talking about a scorched earth policy against corruption, where Accountability, Retribution, Justice, and Exposure aren't just buzzwords; they're the new order of the day. We need to drag the truth into the light, no matter how ugly it is, and ensure those who've fvcked America over face real consequences. 

üî• The Vanguard of Retribution:
üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Kash Patel: ""We're not just uncovering corruption; we're dismantling it. Every traitor will be exposed, every lie will be laid bare.""
‚öñÔ∏è Pam Bondi: ""Justice delayed is justice denied. We're not just going to prosecute; we're going to annihilate the corruption in our legal system.""
üöÄ Elon Musk/Vivek Ramaswamy: ""We're here to cut through the bullshit. Transparency isn't just an ideal; it's our weapon against the shadow games of the establishment.""
üöî Tom Homan: ""I've seen the underbelly of crime. Now, it's time to show the criminals in suits what real law enforcement looks like.""
üó≥Ô∏è Roger Stone: ""They've tried to cancel us, but now, it's retribution time. We'll make sure those who attacked our liberties get what's coming.""
üìö Michael Flynn: ""This isn't just about justice; it's about a restoration. We'll bring down those who've betrayed our country.""
üì∞ Mollie Hemingway: ""The age of cover-ups is over. We'll ensure every corrupt act sees the light of day, and the public knows the truth.""
üì∫ Steve Bannon: ""This is our declaration of war on the deep state. We're not just fighting for America; we're fighting to save it.""

üåê What Should Be Done to the Traitors of the Republic?
1. Public Exposure: Drag their names through the mud, ensure every American knows who they are and what they've done.
2. Criminal Prosecution: No cushy plea deals. They should face the maximum penalties for their crimes.
3. Asset Forfeiture: Seize every dime they've made through corruption.
4. Defund and Dismantle: Destroy the corrupt institutions from within, leaving no trace of their influence.
5. Lifetime Ban: Bar them from any form of public service or lobbying forever.
6. Mandatory Testimony: Force them to testify under oath about their actions, with immunity off the table.
7. Restitution: Make them pay back for the damage they've caused to the country, the people, and democracy itself.
8. Public Shaming: A modern-day pillory, not with stocks, but with inescapable public scorn and historical infamy.

This isn't about settling scores; it's about restoring America's soul. What do you say? Let's get this conversation viral! üî•üî•üî•",Sun Dec 01 20:36:44 +0000 2024,0.020889933820968317,Support

What these analysts ignore is that India's misguided policy of providing unquestioned support to a brutal dictator helped lead to the popular uprising.   India has been consistently wrong on Bangladesh, misunderstanding the mood in the country and stoking anti-Indian sentiment.   While U.S. policy in recent years has not been perfect, its standing in Bangladesh is currently much higher than that of India. 

Why would an America First foreign policy choose to back a loser like India?  As events in July and August proved, the people of Bangladesh will choose their own destiny.   The Indians could not keep Hasina in power, and despite the conspiracy theories, no outside hand was responsible for her ouster.   @ChiefAdviserGoB and his government have a popular mandate paid for with the blood of the martyrs of the long July.   Hasina and her cronies are not coming back.   

The choice that the Trump Administration will have in January is simple.  Should the U.S. continue to build a relationship with a reformed and democratic Bangladesh that can be a partner in the Indo Pacific and  beyond?    If so, then there are opportunities for the U.S. to expand trade and investment, people to people ties, and security cooperation with Bangladesh -- before and after elections.   The alternative is for the U.S. to tie itself to India and lose support and influence among the people of Bangladesh for generations (as it did by mistakenly supporting Pakistan in 1971).

India is fond about talking about strategic autonomy.    In this case, the United States should also pursue a similar approach to Bangladesh.   President Trump and his team should pursue U.S. interests vis a vis Bangladesh and not fall for the trap of becoming India's handmaiden.",Sun Dec 01 12:50:50 +0000 2024,0.14285714285714285,Support

Liberal women are sterilizing themselves in response to President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs win earlier this month, according to a new report from Newsweek.
The outlet spoke to five women who are so concerned about losing access to abortions that they are having their fallopian tubes removed over the election results.

‚ÄúIf I am to be denied any rights in the next four (or more) years, I will not give them up without a fight,‚Äù 28-year-old Texas resident Lydia Echols told Newsweek.

A 39-year-old from Washington, who asked to remain anonymous, told the outlet that she has already undergone a bilateral salpingectomy, removing her fallopian tubes, over Trump.

‚ÄúI am not happy that I felt forced into a surgery I did not want to alter my body, I feel like the election tied my hands and forced me to be sterilized‚Äîthat is horrible,‚Äù the unhinged liberal told Newsweek.

‚ÄúI paid way too much attention to the vitriol Trump repeatedly spit during his previous term,‚Äù she continued, ‚Äúand am keenly aware of the people he keeps around him and in his ear, who all seem to see women as incubators and possessions to subjugate.‚Äù

The woman said she scheduled the surgery in October and planned to cancel the appointment if Kamala Harris had won. Her husband already had a vasectomy in 2021.

‚ÄúWith Trump‚Äôs victory, we quickly learned that my choice to cancel the surgery had been taken from me,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe both believed that I had no choice but to proceed to ensure that I can protect my health should I be assaulted during a Trump presidency, should my husband‚Äôs vasectomy fail and/or should my hormonal birth control become inaccessible.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a wanted procedure, but one of necessity due to the politics and subjugation coming our way.‚Äù

Georgia resident Morgan Wood, 24, told Newsweek that she has a consultation to be sterilized on December 5.

‚ÄúI have no idea what Trump will and won‚Äôt follow through on,‚Äù Wood said, ‚ÄúI was already upset when Roe v Wade was overturned. Living in the South, our prospects for protections and resources aren‚Äôt great if they aren‚Äôt otherwise ensured.‚Äù

Wood added, ‚Äútalks of complicating the birth control and abortion access processes even further made this feel like the only option. I need everything handled, and ideally before power begins shifting.‚Äù

Ashley Hedden, 36, of Kentucky, claims to be ‚Äúasexual‚Äù and told the outlet that the only way she would get pregnant would be if she was raped, and wants to be sterilized for that reason.

‚ÄúThe only way I would get pregnant is if I were raped, and I refuse to be forced to carry the result of a man‚Äôs violence against my will,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI have seen that this country will not protect people that can get pregnant, and have seen the reports of the deaths of pregnant women that were refused medical care. I refuse to be a person that ends up not being able to get medical care just because I own a uterus with some cells growing in it.‚Äù

Florida resident Eden Ixora, 25, said she decided to get sterilized over a massively viral joke made by podcaster Nick Fuentes in which he said, ‚ÄúYour body, my choice.‚Äù

‚ÄúAll the political noise is what really finalized my decision for me,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt just Trump winning but rather all the online rhetoric that followed.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor me it was a call to action,‚Äù Ixora said. ‚ÄúA need to get this locked in so I don‚Äôt have to live in fear that at any moment some random guy can completely destroy my life. For me the idea of getting pregnant is worse than death. I‚Äôm doing what I can to protect my right to choose. I am choosing me.‚Äù

Trump does not support a national abortion ban, writing on Truth Social last month that he would veto such an effort.

As we reported, President-elect Donald Trump has now nominated Kash Patel for the spot of FBI Director.

Patel is a big favorite of Trump supporters and it's also going to be hard to argue that he isn't qualified. He's an attorney who has handled many trials, and served as Chief of Staff at the Department of Defense, Deputy Director of National Intelligence, and Senior Director for Counterterrorism at the National Security Council.

How do you know it's a good pick? All the right people are upset. They know that Patel is not just going to be a status quo, ordinary Republican, and that he's going to clean things up.

Former FBI official Andrew McCabe was throwing a fit on CNN immediately after the announcement. Imagine CNN having the disgraced McCabe on for an opinion about anything, much less about this.

It's a terrible development for the men and women of the FBI and also for the nation that depends on a highly functioning, professional, independent Federal Bureau of Investigation.¬†

The fact that Kash Patel is profoundly unqualified for this job is not even like a matter for debate.

What we should really be thinking about right now is what does this signal in terms of Donald Trump's intent for the FBI?

Such a nomination ""can only possibly be a plan to disrupt, to dismantle, to distract the FBI,"" McCabe said, and ""to possibly"" use the FBI as a ""tool"" for Trump's ""political agenda.""

There is a plan to ""disrupt"" and ""dismantle"" -- any further misuse or weaponization of the FBI. This is one of those positions that the people have given Trump a mandate to address, and Patel has made it clear he will turn the focus back on fighting crime again, as he said on the ""Shawn Ryan"" show.

The US has always made a huge deal about being anti-communism, what with ""Reds under the bed"" paranoia and McCarthyism, from both Democrats and Republicans. To be communist or even socialist, is to be left wing. Israel and their politics are most definitely not left wing, because if they were, then the US would not be supporting them as strongly as they do. The US does not even have a ""left"", despite what some furious outraged right-wingers would claim that Kamala Harris is a ""Marxist"", which again, is utter bollocks.
