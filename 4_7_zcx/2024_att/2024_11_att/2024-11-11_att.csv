Now it should be stated that no one in our group possesses a CCIE. We do not claim to be network experts, we're just malware nerds.

Additionally, we would like to note we did indeed watch this entire video. Despite this woman's jargon and clear ... plainly wrong information... we decided to give her a chance to speak her mind and opinion.

President Donald Trump achieved a historic victory in the 2024 presidential election, securing 312 electoral votes to Vice President Harris's 226 and completing an unprecedented sweep of all seven battleground states: Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Georgia.

This marked the largest electoral victory margin since Obama's 2012 win.

The scope of Trump's victory extended beyond electoral college votes: he secured over 74 million votes, the highest raw vote total ever achieved by a Republican presidential candidate, with a margin of approximately 4 million votes over Harris, making him the first Republican to win the popular vote since George W. Bush in 2004.

Particularly notable was Trump's performance in traditionally Democratic states like New York and California, where he secured 44% and 40% of the vote respectively, marking improvements of 12 and 6 points from his 2020 showing.

President Trump addressed supporters after the race was called, outlining his vision for what he termed would be the ""golden age of America.""",Mon Nov 11 04:25:36 +0000 2024,0.23037296037296034,Support

Over 5,000 immigrant children were separated from their parents.

You see, white nationalist Stephen Miller crafted a  ‚Äúzero-tolerance‚Äù policy.

This policy required the criminal prosecution of ALL adults crossing the border illegally, including asylum seekers. 

This resulted in children being taken from their parents and placed in federal shelters or foster care. 

They barely kept track of where these children were taken, all by design, making reunifications difficult. 

When Joe Biden took office, his administration established a task force to reunite separated families. Hundreds have been reunited, but many remain separated. 

And so it shall begin again because cruelty is always the point.

CNN, citing two sources familiar with the plans, first reported the appointment, which does not require confirmation by the Senate. Vice President-elect JD Vance said the choice of Miller, a longtime adviser who helped Trump craft immigration policy and speeches, was ""another fantastic pick by the president.""

During Trump‚Äôs first term, Miller advocated for the separation of migrant children from their parents as a deterrent for illegal immigration, as well as a travel ban targeting refugees and visitors coming from a handful of majority-Muslim countries.

After leaving the White House following Trump's 2020 election loss, Miller founded a conservative nonprofit group, America First Legal Foundation, that he called ""the long-awaited answer to the ACLU"" (American Civil Liberties Union).

Miller said in an interview with the New York Times earlier this year that ""Trump will unleash the vast arsenal of federal powers to implement the most spectacular migration crackdown."" As part of that, Miller said, the administration will shift from arresting specific immigrants who illegally entered the U.S. to carrying out sweeps and raids at workplaces and other public places.

The policy, first enacted by former President Barack Obama, allows undocumented immigrants who entered the country as children to remain in the U.S. if they meet certain requirements.

Looks like some federal employees are suddenly ‚Äútraumatized‚Äù because Donald Trump is putting his loyal supporters into key roles. ü§î Funny how they weren‚Äôt so bothered when Biden filled his administration with old pals like Anthony Blinken from the Biden Penn Center, or Ron Klain, his right-hand guy from VP days. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

These same bureaucrats had secret meetings before Trump even took office, plotting to thwart his agenda‚Ä¶ but now they‚Äôre losing it because he wants people who will actually follow his plans to fix the country? ü§Ø

Isn‚Äôt it the President‚Äôs job to appoint people who support his policies? Last time we checked, that‚Äôs exactly what Biden‚Äôs been doing with his loyalist-packed team: Susan Rice, John Kerry, and countless other Obama-Biden insiders. ü§´

So, here‚Äôs a question‚Ä¶ why the double standard? üí• Why is it ‚ÄúPTSD‚Äù when Trump does it but ‚Äúgood governance‚Äù when Biden does the same?

I have a big proposal for you.  

Right now, we're at an unprecedented level of breaking the cancel culture stranglehold, as more Trump supporters are speaking out.  

That includes eSports competitors.   

As you may or may not know, the eSports industry revenues is projected to generate almost 2 billion dollars in 2025, and there is an untapped market of content creators willing to support a platform that will not stifle their free speech.  

However, there is still a slient majority in this industry, who have no support and are afraid of their sunk cost being disintegrated.  

I recently had a meet with @UnclePudge_ and some of your other partners about this issue.

People are fired up to have support.¬†It‚Äôs amazing because we all became so numb I don‚Äôt think we realized how bad until we finally have hope again. Everyone so happy about Homan's return.""

ICE official: ""I feel that people know now they will get to do the work they signed up to do. And that they want to do. They know they can get the bad guys now. Public safety threats, national security threats, gang members,¬†here we come!""

ICE officer: ‚Äú[Morale] super high. Especially with the Homan news too.‚Äù

AZ Border Patrol agent: ""Ecstatic¬†to go to work! Morale is even higher than the first time he won.""

CA Border Patrol agent: ""We've all been hopeful but the giveups are still trickling in. Nothing will change until Tom Homan takes the leash off us.""

TX Border Patrol agent: ""Oh dude people who were going to retire are not and everyone is happy.""

Border Patrol union also tells FOX agent morale is surging.¬†

Lots of excitement about Tom Homan being named Border Czar. Widely respected within Border Patrol & ICE.¬†

But it gets even worse...

Miller has been selected for his new role before Trump has even announced the more traditionally important picks for Attorney General, Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, or National Security Adviser.

What this indicates is that Trump is far more fixated on implementing his far-right ""mass deportation"" plans than on protecting and running our nation. The suffering these men will unleash is impossible to calculate.

Vice President-Elect J.D. Vance rushed to X to praise Trump's ""fantastic pick"" because as we we all know by now, Vance is an obsequious lapdog incapable of criticizing even the worst decisions of his boss.

We're headed towards the worst presidential administration in history ‚Äî but we refuse to give up. If American democracy is going to survive four more years of Donald Trump it will take every single one of us. We can't give in. We must fight on!

Kai - the 17-year-old daughter of Don Jr. and his ex-wife Vanessa - shared an inside glimpse into her family's election night festivities in a new video uploaded to her YouTube channel on Monday.

The teenager documented the moments leading up to Donald's victory against Kamala Harris, and reflected on the emotional moment that they found out her grandfather would officially become the next US President.

The vlog started with Kai getting ready for the big night, which involved her getting her hair and makeup professionally done before she switched into her shimmering, black, strapless mini dress and a pair of gold heels.

If Biden isn't running the show, then neither is Trump. He isn't high enough in the global power hierarchy.

The changes he'll make will be within the acceptable range as determined by those in control.

This isn't a black pill; it's a red pill because it is the truth. This means that putting your faith in a political leader who, whether you like it or not, is not anti-establishment will invariably lead to disappointment because he will not save you (or America or the world).

For example, Elon Musk is very close to Trump and is a strong advocate of carbon taxes, electric cars, solar power, putting chips into people's heads, and surrounding Earth with a digital surveillance grid. He also appointed Linda Yaccarino, who is high up in the World Economic Forum. I recommend Whitney Webb's piece (https://t.co/32KrEFpY0O) on why Trump could introduce Sustainable Development in a sexy way that will appeal to Republicans without them realising.

Watch if Trump removes America from the Paris Agreement‚Äîthat would be a step in the (far) right direction. It's just one of many things to look out for.

Just because Trump won doesn't mean Agenda 2030 has ended or that technocracy isn't advancing under a different brand.

When Trump left office in 2020, one of the takeaways from his admin was that they were too inexperienced and underprepared for D.C. Many in Trumpworld openly admitted this (that he failed vs. ""the deep state"") before campaign season really started. For a couple of years it seemed like their plan to fix that in a potential second term was with initiatives like Project 2025 -- essentially, policy wonking the Trump worldview and implementing it with people who had experiencing navigating D.C. Personally, I thought this was a wise reaction to the first term failures.

In the last few months of the campaign, though, something seems to have shifted. Trump distanced himself from and became disenchanted by the Heritage type conservative leader, and is now leaning into some of his surrogates as he transitions to governing; that is the Elon Musk (taking phone calls with world leaders), Vivek Ramaswamy (being talked about for a Senate appointment), and RFK Jr. types (keeps insisting he is going to have a major role in healthcare).

One initial theory that I'm operating on is that if Trump spends the first year or two of his presidency listening to people with zero government experience about how to get things done in D.C., he is once again going to waste half his term running into roadblocks, failures, and legal challenges. This would be a very similar mistake/instinct that Trump followed in 2016, which cost him pretty dearly.",Mon Nov 11 12:48:20 +0000 2024,0.03652248289345064,Support
