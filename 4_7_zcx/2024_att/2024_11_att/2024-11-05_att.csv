https://t.co/TNESEnbutA
The last-minute, voter-free nomination of Kamala Harris didn‚Äôt exactly inspire democrat voters.
While President Trump had to duck real bullets, her own political allies shot down Kamala‚Äôs campaign.
President Biden called every Trump supporter in America ‚Äúgarbage.‚Äù
President Clinton reminded democrat voters that nursing student Laken Riley in Georgia didn‚Äôt have to die. Clinton told Peachtree state voters Harris‚Äô failure to vet illegal alien invaders killed Riley.
President Obama tried to shame young black men into voting for Harris based on skin color.
Harris gave her VP slot to self-described ‚Äúknucklehead‚Äù Tim Walz, skipping over Pennsylvania‚Äôs Josh Shapiro because he‚Äôs Jewish. Muslim voters, notably in Michigan, organized anti-Harris voter drives because she doesn‚Äôt hate the Jews enough.
And the federal Department of Injustice kept reminding Americans for weeks about the non-citizen voters casting ballots by filing crazy lawsuits to force states to keep those illegals on the voter rolls.
Get ready for a pandemic of Trump Derangement Syndrome‚Ä¶and board up your windows.",Tue Nov 05 16:40:54 +0000 2024,0.04415204678362574,Support

Casey has won 3x already in PA.  

If he could win by linking himself to Harris then he would do that.

But he can't because he knows she isn't going to win.

I'll even share my method, since I don't think it can really be taught.

First, I ignore all of the issues and all policy.

Second, I constantly take the temperature of both major sides of the aisle among the masses. I get a feel for how Ds and Rs feel, and everyone else, too. Centrists, Libertarians, Greens, whatever.

Third, I scan the field of potential party nominees or candidates or whoever. 

Fourth, I pretend that I'm the most evil possible Illuminati figure. I control the election and I can pick who wins by myself. 

Then I ask myself, ""which candidate's victory would cause the people of the USA - and to a lesser extent, the rest of the world - to be more emotionally reactive and therefore easier to control?""

I haven't been wrong so far, although I don't apply this to races smaller than famous and contentious congressional races or Supreme Court appointments. I've only made 15 to 20 predictions at most, but I've never been wrong.

I openly predicted Trump would win while living in a deep blue city back before he started mopping the floor with Jeb Bush in the 2016 debates. My Uber passengers gave me only 4 stars after those rides.

I predicted Obama would win in 2005. I said it during a political sociology class that was as woke as it got back then, and only the instructor even knew who Obama was. He also said ""I wish I had your optimism,"" because he was a black marxist revolutionary and he had the attitude that the USA would never elect a black President.

A Kamala win tonight would intensify the anger and disgust from the right, but it's already intense. I don't believe that any of them, no matter how extreme, would get violent over it.

It would also increase the smug sense of superiority on the left, but they're already maximum smug. They view everyone who disagrees with them about anything more consequential than ""what's your favorite kind of sushi"" as a completely worthless moron who shouldn't be treated as a real human.

A Trump win tonight (or more likely in a month or so after everyone's exhausted from screaming at each other) would cause the left to get violent again, as we know they like to do (and are encouraged and allowed to do), and it would also make the right react to that violence more chaotically than before.

I believe that whatever is likely to cause the most division, hate, anger, instability, damage, and chaos is always the best prediction metric.

I think we should expect to see:
- the government struggling to count votes
- the media pulling out the most obvious possible lies to make it look like their guy won
- no decision tonight or for a few weeks at least, OR several decisions that keep getting undone and changed
- Trump eventually takes it
- the left challenges the win with every penny in their bank accounts and every calorie in their bodies
- people get mad in the streets again
- the government uses the chaos to pass new laws and executive orders clamping down on our freedoms

It's not that I WANT these things to happen. I hate them. It's just that for some crazy reason I can't put my finger on, it seems like every election ends in the maximum level of discord between Americans, and a Kamala win won't achieve that.

I prefer Trump to win (although I don't exactly like him or most of who he chooses as his staff), but I also think it'll cause a little more hell for everyone if he does.

I look forward to being wrong (about the hell part)!",Tue Nov 05 23:25:33 +0000 2024,0.05581062728121551,Support

With only minutes left before polls close, the Washington Post has published a sensational ‚ÄúHitler poll‚Äù story, alleging that nearly half of Trump supporters would still vote for a candidate with ‚Äúovert appreciation of Hitler.‚Äù 

Critics are calling this an outrageous attempt to paint Trump voters as aligned with extremist views, based on a survey that sampled a tiny fraction of the electorate and then generalized to millions.

Polling experts note that such surveys are only estimates, yet the Post‚Äôs timing and framing fuel a divisive narrative: if you‚Äôre for Trump, you‚Äôre lumped in with a small, extreme subset of voters.

He is better for economy (smaller government, potential for more reforms, esp overdue on tax side) and better for foreign policy (would simply do less evil (and USA has been doing a lot, if not most evil for the last 80+ years internationally) while his volatile personality is a much better deterrent than meaningless ""red lines"" - it is what it is...).

That being said, I think it's intellectually dishonest to portray Harris as a guaranteed death for crypto who will make USA a marxist shithole. As it is similarly intellectually dishonest to say Trump 100% will create the fourth reich and put all childless cat ladies and progressive news journalists into concentration camps. 

Both of these dishonest visions are also incredibly unpatriotic/disrespectful - like what kind of clown country are you if a single person can unwind 250 years  of institutional buildup, traditions, checks and balances etc? Incredibly pathetic. America that I studied and admired at uni was the land of opportunity, equality (not equity!) and a living proof that capitalism is the single best thing humans created for economic coordination and eradication of poverty (until crypto came alongüôÉ).  Is it unjust? Of course. Is it corrupt? Yep. Is two party system idiotic? Absolutely! But  pretty much most other ""democracies"" of big enough size are not that much better (I live in one of them across the pond). And meanwhile it is also number one driver of scientific progress globally and the single most important market. It's not something one person can/should take down easily.

https://t.co/gQjYpEqq4H

He said that given Trump's ""America First"" mantra, he will have little interest in U.S.-Japan or U.S.-South Korea relations and that as a result ""Japan will have to conduct its own foreign policy [and] find a skillful way to manage the power balance with China, Russia and North Korea... This should be a golden opportunity for Japan. We can take back the initiative and become a truly independent country.""

Kawakami also expressed frustration that 85% of Japan's skies are, in effect, ""America's skies"" (a large portion of the airspace has been reserved for the exclusive use of American forces since the end of World War II) and that ""U.S. military bases account for a substantial acreage of land, too"" - a status quo he called ""abnormal.""

I've myself argued the exact same point for Europe since the very first Trump administration: when Trump was threatening to exit NATO, Europe should immediately have taken him at his word and jumped on this amazing opportunity to take over NATO and thereby remove the stranglehold that the US has over the continent. By the same occasion, they might have been able to prevent the Ukraine war by throwing the Americans out and stop it being the ""CIA theme park"" described by journalist John Pilger (https://t.co/L4KqrBvBMV).

Unfortunately it looks like Europeans are a bit (even a lot) slower to understand geopolitics than the rest of the world... Everyone else around the world sees them as clueless vassals being sacrificed on the altar of the American empire but they themselves are largely oblivious to it. Heck ask most EU politicians and they're immensely worried at the notion that they might one day be independent, it's something they largely want to prevent, which is terrifyingly depressing...",Tue Nov 05 03:15:51 +0000 2024,0.09070197044334974,Support

It predicts a Trump victory

---
‚Äã‚ÄãTo assess the potential outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election, we can adjust current swing state polling data to account for biases observed in the 2016 and 2020 elections, and then run simulations to estimate the probability of each candidate winning.‚Äã‚Äã

1. Identify Key Swing States: ‚Äã‚ÄãThe primary swing states in the 2024 election include:‚Äã‚Äã ‚Äã‚Äã- Arizona

Georgia

Michigan

Nevada

North Carolina

Pennsylvania

Wisconsin‚Äã‚Äã

2. Gather Current Polling Data: ‚Äã‚ÄãRecent polling averages for these states are as follows:‚Äã‚Äã ‚Äã‚Äã- Arizona: Trump 52.3%, Harris 45.8% ‚Äã‚Äã

Georgia: Trump 50.1%, Harris 47.6% ‚Äã‚Äã

Michigan: Harris 49%, Trump 46% ‚Äã‚Äã

Nevada: Trump 51.2%, Harris 46% ‚Äã‚Äã

North Carolina: Trump 50.5%, Harris 47.1% ‚Äã‚Äã

Pennsylvania: Trump 49.6%, Harris 47.8% ‚Äã‚Äã

Wisconsin: Harris 48%, Trump 48% ‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã

3. Adjust for Historical Polling Bias: ‚Äã‚ÄãIn the 2016 and 2020 elections, polls in certain swing states underestimated Republican support. For instance, Wisconsin polls overestimated Democratic support by approximately 7% in both elections ‚Äã‚Äã. To adjust for this bias:‚Äã‚Äã ‚Äã‚Äã- Arizona: Adjust Trump +2%

Georgia: Adjust Trump +2%

Michigan: Adjust Trump +3%

Nevada: Adjust Trump +2%

North Carolina: Adjust Trump +2%

Pennsylvania: Adjust Trump +3%

Wisconsin: Adjust Trump +4%‚Äã‚Äã

4. Calculate Adjusted Polling Averages: ‚Äã‚ÄãApplying these adjustments:‚Äã‚Äã ‚Äã‚Äã- Arizona: Trump 54.3%, Harris 43.8%

Georgia: Trump 52.1%, Harris 45.6%

Michigan: Trump 49%, Harris 46%

Nevada: Trump 53.2%, Harris 44%

North Carolina: Trump 52.5%, Harris 45.1%

Pennsylvania: Trump 52.6%, Harris 44.8%

Wisconsin: Trump 52%, Harris 44%‚Äã‚Äã

5. Run Monte Carlo Simulations: ‚Äã‚ÄãUsing these adjusted averages, we can perform 80,000 simulations to estimate the probability of each candidate winning the election.‚Äã‚Äã

6. Simulation Results: ‚Äã‚ÄãBased on the adjusted polling data and simulations, the estimated probabilities are:‚Äã‚Äã ‚Äã‚Äã- Donald Trump: 85%

Kamala Harris: 15%‚Äã‚Äã

Conclusion: ‚Äã‚ÄãAfter adjusting for historical polling biases and conducting extensive simulations, Donald Trump appears to have a significant advantage in the 2024 presidential election.‚Äã‚Äã However, it's important to note that simulations are based on current data and assumptions; actual election outcomes can be influenced by various unpredictable factors.",Tue Nov 05 16:14:54 +0000 2024,0.07347883597883598,Support

‚ÄòInterviewer: People are particularly concerned about what would happen if Trump becomes president again. Although it‚Äôs not widely discussed, what would Japan-U.S. relations look like under Trump?
Kawakami: Japan would finally be able to achieve independence. Trump‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù philosophy means he is unconcerned with Japan-U.S. relations, NATO, or U.S.-South Korea relations. During his last term, Japan was able to maintain a good relationship with the U.S. because of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who got along well with Trump. But with Abe gone, Trump would likely take a harder line with Japan. Japan would no longer be able to rely on U.S. support as it has in the past, and would need to develop an independent foreign policy.
This shift would bring up discussions on fundamentally strengthening Japan‚Äôs defense capabilities. However, Japan would need to carefully balance power not only with the U.S., but also with China, Russia, and North Korea. This could be an opportunity for Japan to become a ‚Äútruly independent country‚Äù and take the lead.
Currently, 85% of Japan‚Äôs airspace is controlled by the U.S., and a significant amount of land is used for U.S. military bases. Frankly, this is abnormal. Japan needs to reduce U.S. bases and become a ‚Äúnormal country.‚Äù Trump‚Äôs presidency would create an environment that allows Japan to defend its sovereignty with its own strategy against foreign forces.
‚Ä¶
Interviewer: There are concerns that if Trump becomes president, there would be a risk of war. However, he has never actually initiated a war, yet Japanese media often downplay this while building up Harris.
Kawakami: Japan has followed the U.S. lead under the Biden administration. As a result, those who criticized the Democratic Party were sidelined in politics and on TV commentary shows. Now that Biden‚Äôs administration is nearing its end, Harris is next in line. This ensures Japan remains under a Democratic administration‚Äôs influence, and narratives that ‚ÄúHarris is likely to win‚Äù gain traction.
However, after Shigeru Ishiba became the LDP leader and Japan‚Äôs 102nd Prime Minister, the LDP has changed significantly. If Trump were to make a comeback as U.S. president, a very different Japan-U.S. relationship from before would emerge.‚Äô

Freedom OR Communism. Strength OR Weakness. Traditional Values or Woke Agenda. Dignity OR Embarrassment. 

Today, Americans face a pivotal choice in the 2024 presidential election, which many view as a stark decision between two contrasting visions:

TRUMP ~ HIS campaign emphasizes freedom, strength, and traditional values. WE see him as a leader who will prioritize American interests, enhance military strength, and resist the liberals woke agenda. TRUMP will keep his promises to end inflation, strengthen borders, and restore the American Dream and put the world‚Äôs cartels, despots, dictators and terrorists on notice. 

HARRIS ~ SHE would lead us down a different path, with progressive policies that would see us moving towards a socialist/communist path of governance. Her campaign and supporters are advocating for social equity, environmental sustainability, and a broader definition of American values that includes inclusivity and diversity. In other words, she would force a change on America to suit her vision. And‚Ä¶ There can be no argument she would project weakness and embarrassment on the global stage due to her obvious lack of experience and inability to be decisive and show policy strength or military might on international relations. 

This election encapsulates a choice between:

- FREEDOM versus a more regulated society where government plays a larger role. 
- STRENGTH in terms of military and national security versus a focus on diplomacy and international cooperation.
- TRADITIONAL VALUES rooted in historical American culture versus a Woke Agenda which pushes for social justice, equality, and reevaluation of cultural norms.
- DIGNITY in the sense of national pride and identity versus what some perceive as an embarrassment in terms of how the country is managed or its international image.

The choice voters make today will not only determine the leadership for the next term but will also reflect the direction Americans want their country to take in terms of policy, values, and global standing.

I'll even share my method, since I don't think it can really be taught.

First, I ignore all of the issues and all policy.

Second, I constantly take the temperature of both major sides of the aisle among the masses. I get a feel for how Ds and Rs feel, and everyone else, too. Centrists, Libertarians, Greens, whatever.

Third, I scan the field of potential party nominees or candidates or whoever. 

Fourth, I pretend that I'm the most evil possible Illuminati figure. I control the election and I can pick who wins by myself. 

Then I ask myself, ""which candidate's victory would cause the people of the USA - and to a lesser extent, the rest of the world - to be more emotionally reactive and therefore easier to control?""

I haven't been wrong so far, although I don't apply this to races smaller than famous and contentious congressional races or Supreme Court appointments. I've only made 15 to 20 predictions at most, but I've never been wrong.

I openly predicted Trump would win while living in a deep blue city back before he started mopping the floor with Jeb Bush in the 2016 debates. My Uber passengers gave me only 4 stars after those rides.

I predicted Obama would win in 2005. I said it during a political sociology class that was as woke as it got back then, and only the instructor even knew who Obama was. He also said ""I wish I had your optimism,"" because he was a black marxist revolutionary and he had the attitude that the USA would never elect a black President.

A Kamala win tonight would intensify the anger and disgust from the right, but it's already intense. I don't believe that any of them, no matter how extreme, would get violent over it.

It would also increase the smug sense of superiority on the left, but they're already maximum smug. They view everyone who disagrees with them about anything more consequential than ""what's your favorite kind of sushi"" as a completely worthless moron who shouldn't be treated as a real human.

A Trump win tonight (or more likely in a month or so after everyone's exhausted from screaming at each other) would cause the left to get violent again, as we know they like to do (and are encouraged and allowed to do), and it would also make the right react to that violence more chaotically than before.

I believe that whatever is likely to cause the most division, hate, anger, instability, damage, and chaos is always the best prediction metric.

I think we should expect to see:
- the government struggling to count votes
- the media pulling out the most obvious possible lies to make it look like their guy won
- no decision tonight or for a few weeks at least, OR several decisions that keep getting undone and changed
- Trump eventually takes it
- the left challenges the win with every penny in their bank accounts and every calorie in their bodies
- people get mad in the streets again
- the government uses the chaos to pass new laws and executive orders clamping down on our freedoms

It's not that I WANT these things to happen. I hate them. It's just that for some crazy reason I can't put my finger on, it seems like every election ends in the maximum level of discord between Americans, and a Kamala win won't achieve that.

I prefer Trump to win (although I don't exactly like him or most of who he chooses as his staff), but I also think it'll cause a little more hell for everyone if he does.

I look forward to being wrong (about the hell part)!",Tue Nov 05 23:25:33 +0000 2024,0.05581062728121551,Support

For a lot of people, this prediction will come as a shock, and if I‚Äôm honest, it comes with some hesitation on my part as well. This call isn‚Äôt something I arrived at lightly. It‚Äôs a result of months of tracking trends, poring over early vote data, and adapting my model to all the information I can possibly get my hands on. 

I‚Äôll explain how I got here, but let me start with an admission: yes, there‚Äôs a chance I‚Äôm wrong. But as the Oracle of Delphi warned, ‚ÄúSurety brings ruin,‚Äù and I‚Äôd rather be humble with my uncertainty than falsely confident about any outcome.

First, a bit of context. Over the past few cycles, I‚Äôve worked hard to refine a model for Virginia‚Äôs elections that accurately reflected what actually happened‚Äîwhether in 2019, 2020, 2021, or 2023. Each cycle, I had to make adjustments and learn from the new trends unfolding, and each time I adjusted, my model held strong. 

My only regret is not being able to model out the 2022 midterms. If I had done so, I am confident I would have been able to foresee the ‚ÄúRed Ripple‚Äù rather than the Red Wave I foolishly predicted based on vibes and little else.

But every election is different, and 2024 has presented unprecedented challenges. This election is unlike any other I‚Äôve analyzed in Virginia, particularly due to massive shifts in how people vote. Republicans who once avoided early voting have shown up in record numbers, while Democrats, previously dominant in early voting, appear to be pulling back to election day. 

Virginia‚Äôs early vote data has always been an essential part of my model, and I‚Äôve used it with great success in the past. But this time around, the picture it paints is‚Ä¶unusual. My data suggests a very close race, and though my heart hopes for a different outcome, the numbers tell me that Harris has a slight edge.",Tue Nov 05 01:58:23 +0000 2024,0.13066334072431626,Support

Socrates‚Äô State of the Race

We are 1 day out from the 2024 presidential election. This is my feel for the state of the race today.

It is ironically the same as when I first started several months ago. I am seeing so much field activity for Harris, and almost none for Trump. People often need help and motivation to go to the polls.

[In terms of method, I am building one. Semi-scientific isn‚Äôt. But it isn‚Äôt just current polls. I look at trends, funding, field offices and knowledge of each state. I could be wrong, but let‚Äôs just say that I try to make experienced guesses. The main thing that I can promise you is my honest, independent review.]

More than anything, I look at the body, not the ball. It matters not so much what the campaigns are saying, but what they are doing.

Feel free to refer to my previous predictions This is just me writing it in my spare time. I want to thank my sources in various states. I have general knowledge of a number of states, but any local specifics help.

https://t.co/36SdsZwwET

https://t.co/4xkj1l7f8J

https://t.co/3tLNbZuTSn

Arizona
This is one where I have gone back and forth on. My sources in the state say that Harris is blanketing the air waves. She is spending money in the state.

Lake is a very bad candidate and there is moderate down ballot elasticity in AZ.

I was tempted to turn this one Red. But with Lake being down by double digits, I think it will depress Rep votes. And the wreckage from the Trump-cult takeover of the AZ GOP will not help. Add the movements of the McCain family.

Lastly the polls close at 9 pm MST. If Harris gets some early calls in battleground states, it could depress  Rep turnout.

Blue.

Georgia
I predicted that Trump needs to get down on his knees and beg like a dog for Kemp to help him. They
did officially patch things up, but Kemp did not show at Trump‚Äôs rally. I wonder if the governor‚Äôs appointees are only carrying down-ballot Lit.

Also, people would have to be upset that Trump has cheated them out of three US Senate seats in recent years.

If I allowed undecided, it would be in that status.

I don‚Äôt. So still Blue.

Michigan
Again, the Trump cult took over the state party and broke it.

Early voting is surging in Detroit and Ann Arbor. She should win the state.

Nevada
I was ahead of the curve, putting this for Harris weeks ago, but the polls have caught up. I have checked with my local sources and they say that the Trump Cultists damage to the state party is significant. GOTV should be weak.

Ralston has called it narrowly for Harris. It may also be affected by several early calls for Harris.

Blue.

North Carolina
Hurricane Helene is a big factor. Some sources are saying that there was no help; others are going to saying that it was fine. I am go to split the difference and say that it could have been better.

Robinson did nothing to help his chances  determined that there is weak ticket elasticity between the top of the ticket and the downballot in this state. That being said, the Robinson disaster will reduce volunteer effort and morale.

I‚Äôm keeping it Blue.

Pennsylvania
This is like the Battle of Stalingrad. Both sides are pouring forces in. But based upon field reports, it looks like Harris is overwhelming Trump.

And again, I think that Princess Presler is overrated.

Wisconsin

This is the state that I know second-best politically.

Madison early voting is huge. There seems to be some indicators that Waukesha County may have crossover Reps.

Trump has pretty much pulled out.

Other States

Iowa

The Selzer poll hit like a tsunami. Everyone is questioning their methodologies. I don‚Äôt think that Harris is three points up, but of Trump is only five points up, he will definitely lose some swing states.

Florida

I have started reviewing based on recent polls. I still believe that it will hold.

The GOP is also energized to defeat Amendments 3 and 4. Trump‚Äôs Puerto Rican stunt could be costly.

Red.

Texas
Same as FL.

Conclusion
My predictions by state are unchanged. I am trying to double-check my biases, but think that Harris is up by 3-4.

[Again, I do not get paid for this so any sharing would be appreciated. It helps if I can show the Someone that these posts are being read.]",Tue Nov 05 01:28:07 +0000 2024,0.0730601092896175,Support
