The country largely shifted to the right in this presidential election from where it was four years ago.

In 2020, President Biden won six of the seven most closely watched states, but this year, they all shifted toward President-elect Donald Trump.

What's more, Trump is on track to win the popular vote this time, when Biden won it by 7 million in 2020.

Trump won the suburbs

The suburbs have become increasingly diverse and populous. More than half of voters in 2024 were in suburban areas, according to exit polls. They have become swing areas, home to some of the most closely targeted House seats, and a good barometer of who will win the presidential election.

The winner in the suburbs has won 11 of the last 12 presidential elections, dating back to 1980. And this year that was Trump, 51%-47%, according to exit polls.

Vice President Harris was hoping she could turn out women in the suburbs in key swing states to get her across the finish line. But that didn't happen. Trump, for example, won white suburban women by 7 points, as well as white suburban men ‚Äî by 27. So there were some split kitchen tables, but not enough to help Harris win.

In multiple swing states, there were significant shifts in Trump's direction in the suburbs, based on nearly final vote totals. That includes a net swing of almost 60,000 votes in the four counties that make up the Philadelphia suburbs and the two major ones north of Detroit, more than 10,000 in the ""WOW"" counties around Milwaukee (Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington) and in the counties touching Fulton County, Ga., where Atlanta is.

In some of those Atlanta metro counties, though, Harris did better than Biden, and her losses weren't as bad in the Charlotte metro area as in the former Blue Wall states. That's one reason Democrats have been more optimistic about the future in the Sun Belt than the industrial Midwest.

Rural areas went even more for Trump

Trump has done extremely well in rural areas, and in 2024, he won by a record margin. Since 1980, no candidate has done better. Trump won 64% of voters in rural areas this year, according to exit polls. The previous best was 61% ‚Äì set by Trump in 2016.

That helped him in all of the swing states, but also in red states, like Texas, which boosted his total in the popular vote. He gained, for example, a net of more than 900,000 votes in Texas compared to 2020; and more than 1 million in Florida, a longtime competitive state that saw a dramatic swing in Trump's direction.

His improvement in those states also reflects the major shifts in his direction with Latino voters in South Florida and South Texas.

Harris also underperformed in urban areas

A lot of Democratic base voters live in big cities, and those urban areas are often key to a Democrat winning in the swing states. But Harris got just 59% of voters in urban areas, lower than Biden, former President Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton.

That underperformance is a large part of why she lost in key states. For example, in Maricopa County, Ariz., home to Phoenix, Harris got roughly 61,000 fewer votes than Biden in 2020. Trump, on the other hand, gained about 56,000, for a 117,000-vote shift in just one county.

While the mainstream media has focused primarily on Trump supporters during the January 6 Capitol riot, evidence is emerging that far-left anarchists infiltrated the crowd, disguised as Trump supporters, and played a key role in escalating the chaos. This critical aspect of the riot has been largely ignored, but it is crucial to understanding the full scope of the events.

Although I wasn‚Äôt filming at the Capitol on January 6, I had been documenting far-left anarchist groups in Brooklyn and other areas leading up to the event. These groups had coordinated their efforts to travel to Washington, D.C., arriving by car, van, plane, and caravans. They were actively involved in stoking violence at the Capitol.

One anarchist I spoke with shared that, as he was leaving a hotel to head to the Capitol, he saw Proud Boys nearby and became nervous. However, because he was dressed as a Trump supporter, he was able to blend in without being recognized. This shows how anarchists strategically disguised themselves to infiltrate the crowd while advancing their disruptive agenda.

I also caught anarchist Talia Jane on camera at a protest, dressed as a Trump supporter. When confronted, she lied about being there, falsely claiming she was in D.C. as a member of the press‚Äîdespite not having a press pass. Independent photographers confirmed spotting anarchists like Talia Jane at the Capitol, further corroborating the evidence that these groups were embedded within the crowd.

Videos from the day show anarchists changing into Trump supporter clothing as they participated in the riot. Some were filmed wearing black bloc gear and then quickly switching into Trump attire, further muddying the waters between the two factions. This shift in clothing shows that these anarchists were deliberately trying to blend in and escalate the situation.

In the lead-up to the riot, far-left anarchists made calls to action, urging people to come to D.C. and confront Republicans. I have screenshots of these communications, which show their intent to agitate and escalate tensions at the Capitol.

These anarchist groups are notorious for blending into protests and stirring up violence. They‚Äôve done it before‚Äîat the Watson Hotel during a protest involving migrants and at Columbia College during a student protest. Their tactic is to appear as participants or press but are, in fact, organizers pushing their agenda from within the crowd.

A common tactic of these groups is to agitate crowds into violent confrontations and then step back, letting others take the brunt of the consequences from law enforcement. This strategy, which is also adopted by terrorist organizations, allows anarchists to avoid responsibility while others face the heat.

It‚Äôs my opinion that these anarchists played a central role in starting the riot in D.C. and that Trump supporters took the brunt of it. Trump supporters, many of whom were likely confused by the chaos around them, reacted in the only way they knew‚Äîby fighting back. While they were wrong for entering the Capitol and attacking Capitol Police, their reaction must be understood in the context of the anarchists who stirred the violence in the first place.

Despite all the evidence, the mainstream media largely failed to cover the role of anarchists at the Capitol riot. Videos from Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok show anarchists bragging about their participation, yet many of these accounts have been deleted or suspended. I‚Äôm calling on @elonmusk to review these suspended accounts and provide transparency about their involvement in the riot.

While Trump supporters were certainly a major presence at the Capitol, they weren‚Äôt the only ones fueling the violence. Anarchists, disguised as Trump supporters, played a significant role in escalating the riot, and their involvement should not be ignored. 

I'll attach more proof at the bottom.

But as the vote margin is finally settling into its final form the above is important context. The popular vote margin is narrower than we thought it might be election night and is historically slight. GOP is talking about an overwhelming mandate for complete transformation. The results suggest something more measured. A v narrow House win, a non-blowout in the Senate and a comfortable but not overwhelming win in the electoral college/popular vote in a year which was primed against the incumbent party. GOP would do well to recognise the win was very solid but not spectacular and build a strategy from there- because they clearly have an opportunity to permanently expand their coalition.",Fri Nov 22 22:29:38 +0000 2024,0.29197530864197524,Support
