A Romanian constitutional court yesterday, (Nov. 28th 2024) asked the official electoral authority to recount and verify all of the ballots cast, after attempts to cancel the election failed. The US - UK -  EU  & Romanian media have been non-stop smearing Mr CƒÉlin Georgescu, since he won the election round on 25th Nov. 

üîπ Mr. Georgescu won against 13 other candidates in the 1st round  with 22.94% of the votes. Media across the West and in Romania label  him 'pro- Russia', 'far-right', 'NATO critic' and 'ultranationalist' due to  his 'Romania first' position. He was not invited to presidential debates hosted by  Romanian media and didn't pay for political broadcasts on TV, but brilliantly used social media and podcast appearances to get his message out.  

üîπ The European Parliament's üá™üá∫ liberal political group, ""Renew Europe,"" Valerie Hyer, has called on TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew to appear before the European Parliament to address concerns of social media interfering in elections. ANCOM, Romania's telecommunications market regulator will ask for the suspension of the TikTok platform in Romania.

üîπ Romania's Supreme Defense Council met to discuss possible risks to the country and its electoral process stemming from social media. Protesting against the results have started using students also, supported by political parties & NGO's against Mr Georgescu. 

üîπ Mr. Georgescu holds a doctorate in pedology, a branch of soil science, and held different positions in Romania‚Äôs environment ministry in the 1990s. Between 1999 and 2012, he was a representative for Romania on the national committee of the UN Environment Program. He promotes peace for the Ukraine üá∫üá¶üá∑üá∫ conflict and not escalation, supports the Romanian Orthodox Church, Romanian farmers, reducing import dependence, and ramping up local energy and food production.

We're in for the fight of our life. We are the enemy and President Trump and all his administration have targets on their back, literally!! If you haven't noticed yet, we're in a fight of good against evil.

Our incoming 45th and 47th President, Donald J. Trump, was targeted for assassination more than once. Picks for Trump's administration have been harassed by the press and lied about. Some have had threats against their life!

Some of our own party have promised to work against the MAGA/MAHA mandate. They are a threat! 

Even worse are the demonic (YES, I said it) Democrats, who serve Satan and are determined to use every dirty trick in the book to attack anyone who dares rise against them. They are Marxist Communists and are determined to take our Constitutional Republic, through a long-planned Color Revolution, into a tyrannical government (which our Founding Fathers warned against)!

Get your head on straight. Plan, prepare. These are powers and principalities we fight, not just flesh and blood. ""For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places."" Ephesians 6:12

While we remain long-term supporters of Ethereum and its immense potential, it‚Äôs important to recognize its current struggles, including network fragmentation, high fees, and slower transaction times. 

These challenges have opened the door for Solana to emerge as a frontrunner in this bull market cycle.

As Christians, it is our duty to turn to You in times of distress and uncertainty. 
In the aftermath of the recent election, there has been an alarming increase in violent threats against President Trump and his supporters by those on the left who oppose his presidency. 
This is not only a threat to our nation, but to our individual freedoms and safety as well. 
In this prayer, we ask for strength and courage to stand up against these threats and defend ourselves, our families, and our fellow Trump supporters. 
We entrust ourselves to Your protection and guidance as we face and defend ourselves against these violent liberals, knowing that You are always with us. 
We pray that You, Father, may grant wisdom and discernment to those in positions of power to handle this situation with justice, but in the absence of justice, we will protect our own.
We also pray that these violent liberals have a change of heart when they see our strength and resolve, showing them the mighty light of Christ in the midst of this insanity. 
Let us unite in prayer, trusting in Your divine sovereignty and praying for Your will to be done in all things.
In Jesus' name
