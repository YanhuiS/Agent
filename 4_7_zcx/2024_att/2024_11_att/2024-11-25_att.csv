Trump: A Story of Political Mastery

The 2024 presidential election was nothing short of a political spectacle, where Donald J. Trump, once again, proved his detractors wrong. The narrative often pushed by the liberal elite, the media, and Hollywood portrayed Trump as a buffoon, a relic of outdated politics, and an easy target for defeat. However, this underestimation became Trump's secret weapon.

The Liberal Elite's Misjudgment:

From the outset, many in the liberal elite viewed Trump as an anachronism, a candidate who could energize the base but never capture the middle ground. His outsider status, his brash style, and his unfiltered rhetoric were seen as liabilities. Yet, they failed to recognize that these very traits resonated with a segment of Americans feeling alienated by what they perceived as an out-of-touch establishment.

Media's Role:

The media, often accused of liberal bias, played into Trump's hands with every negative headline. Each piece critiquing his character, his policies, or his past business dealings inadvertently kept him in the public eye. Trump understood media dynamics better than most; he turned every attack into an opportunity, using media coverage as free advertising. His ability to dominate the news cycle with controversial statements meant that even those who opposed him couldn't stop talking about him.

Hollywood's Disconnect:

Hollywood, a bastion of liberal thought, ridiculed Trump, with celebrities openly declaring their intent to leave if he won. This disconnect with a large swath of America allowed Trump to position himself as the anti-elite candidate. He appealed directly to those who felt Hollywood was out of touch with the real concerns of everyday Americans, like jobs, security, and national identity.

Connecting with the American People:

- Direct Communication: Trump bypassed traditional media gatekeepers by speaking directly to the people via rallies, social media, and his own platform. His rallies were not just campaign events; they were communal gatherings where supporters felt heard and seen.

- Tapping into Discontent: He articulated the frustrations of those who felt left behind by globalization and technological change, blaming these on policies favored by the liberal elite.

- The Outsider Image: His outsider status was not just a campaign slogan; it was a badge of honor for those tired of career politicians. Trump's narrative as a successful businessman fighting against the political establishment struck a chord.

- Resilience in the Face of Adversity: Every obstacle from lawsuits to attempts on his life only reinforced his image as a fighter. This resilience was not just admired; it was revered by his supporters.

The underestimation by those who thought they wielded cultural and political power over America was Trump's greatest advantage. He turned their scorn into a rallying cry for his supporters. The presidency was not just won; it was seized by an understanding that in American politics, being underestimated can be a formidable weapon if wielded with the right strategy and tenacity.

In the end, Donald Trump's victory in 2024 was a reminder of a fundamental political truth: sometimes, it's not about how much you are loved by the elite, but how deeply you connect with the electorate's heart.",Mon Nov 25 04:13:26 +0000 2024,-0.08333333333333334,Oppose

After years of relentless lawfare aimed at undermining Trump and his supporters, this filing is an admission that the case against him was always on shaky legal ground. The Constitution makes it clear: a sitting president cannot be prosecuted, and this applies to the unique situation of a president-elect as well.

This case has been a political weapon wielded by the Biden-Harris administration and their allies to distract from their own failures and corruption. The fact that these charges were filed during the height of Trump’s campaign was no coincidence—it was an overt attempt to derail the will of the American people. Yet, the voters saw through it, electing Trump in a landslide and rejecting the partisan gamesmanship that has defined the left.

The DOJ’s acknowledgment of constitutional constraints, while overdue, underscores the critical importance of upholding the rule of law, even when it’s inconvenient for political agendas. The Biden-Harris administration, which weaponized the justice system for political gain, should take note: their time in power is coming to an end.

President Trump’s return to the Oval Office will restore accountability, fairness, and justice—qualities sorely missing under this administration. The dismissal of these charges is just the beginning of turning the tide back toward constitutional governance.

Donald Trump announces a new policy against China, citing its failure to crack down on fentanyl production and distribution despite prior promises. 

Accusing Beijing of inaction, Trump vows to impose an additional 10% tariff on all Chinese imports until the drug flow stops. 

“Thank you for your attention to this matter,” he declares, signaling no tolerance for what he calls a devastating crisis fueled by foreign negligence.

He writes, “I have had many talks with China about the massive amounts of drugs, in particular Fentanyl, being sent into the United States – But to no avail. Representatives of China told me that they would institute their maximum penalty, that of death, for any drug dealers caught doing this but, unfortunately, they never followed through, and drugs are pouring into our Country, mostly through Mexico, at levels never seen before. Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America.

The Hollywood elite, ensconced in their echo chambers, fail to see the real America where people value jobs over celebrity opinions, where law and order isn't just a slogan, and where we seek a leader who puts us first. Trump wasn't just a president; he was a movement, embodying the aspirations of millions who yearn for a return to traditional values, economic prosperity, and national pride.

Ritchson and his ilk might never grasp why we rally behind Trump, but it's simple: he fights for us, not for the globalist agenda or the coastal elites. He stands for the forgotten man and woman, for the heartland of America, for those who believe in the Constitution, not in the narrative spun by Hollywood's fantasy.

The deep state cabal would have absolutely cheated to win no different than in 2020.

But that didn't happen even though their literal lives were 100% on the line.

Now, assuming you would tend to agree with me on that then it only makes sense that white hats also know who's who at this point (having a comprehensive naughty/nice list similar to Santa's) regarding the entire theater of events and all involved.  And that's precisely where I believe that trust comes into play because we can't know for sure, not at this point, because duh!

And it's expressly because I trust Trump and the patriots working with him that I similarly trust the process they're navigating us through.

Does it suck going through this grand paradigm shift?

Yup.

But whoever said defeating the largest/wealthiest/most powerful AND entrenched global criminal enterprise in the history of man was going to be easy?

The fact is that nothing less than the future of human civilization hangs in the balance.  That being true, not having this all dialed in at this moment in time makes ZERO sense to me - nor does lighting one's hair on fire and flipping out as all the twists and turns play out.

Not sure where the disconnect is with many of our own who should know better by now based on everything we've learned to date, yet here we are.

That said, hats off to those of you who remain steadfast to the cause and level-headed when it matters most. The massive inflow of newly opening eyes is set to occur on the near event horizon and helping them successfully navigate through all of this is where we can add the most value IMO.

Not only will US support not enrich the US, but it will probably cost it hundreds of billions of dollars when all is said and done. Obviously, some people in the US will make money off it (such as people in the defense industry), but that's a different point and I think it only plays a minor role in US policy toward Ukraine.

Once again, critics of Western foreign policy see it as driven by cynical considerations, but while of course those are sometimes present, they don't explain that much.

This isn’t about principles or some grand awakening—it’s about clinging to relevance in a landscape that’s shifting toward truth, accountability, and actual representation. These people spent years smearing the very movement they now claim to support, and yet here they are, trying to squeeze their way into the room by sidelining Trump’s most loyal allies.

It’s calculated. They think if they play nice now, they can rewrite history and pretend they weren’t part of the mob that weaponized the media, censored dissent, and tried to destroy anyone who didn’t align with their agenda. They’re not “realigning”—they’re protecting their careers and their egos.

We can’t let them gaslight us. The America First movement doesn’t belong to the people who jumped on the train after they spent years trying to derail it. It belongs to the ones who stuck it out when it wasn’t easy or popular.

There is no such thing as a political realignment.

What you’re seeing is people who spent the last 9 years of their life canceling Trump supporters and conservatives wake up and realize they are about to be irrelevant in the new media landscape with Republicans in power, so now you have a bunch of high profile leftists coming out saying things like “I was wrong about Trump”, all while these same people try to actively sideline and cancel Trump’s most loyal supporters. 

That’s all this is. The people who tried to destroy Trump now want a seat at the table and they will do whatever they can to destroy his closest Allies so they can remain relevant. The same leftists who attacked Trump for 9 years are currently at Mar a Lago trying to blackball Donald Trump’s most loyal supporters.

Trump, who is set to be inaugurated on January 20, 2025. The motion cites longstanding DOJ policy and constitutional interpretations by the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), which prohibit the indictment and prosecution of a sitting President.

Everything about this case as I repeated said was and still is unprecedented, as Trump was indicted and prosecuted as a private citizen, but his election to the presidency has triggered the application of the OLC's prohibition. The Special Counsel, bound by this interpretation, argues that the case must be dismissed before Trump's inauguration, regardless of the allegations or stage of the proceedings.

The government writes, ""As a result of the election held on November 5, 2024, the defendant, Donald J. Trump, will be inaugurated as President on January 20, 2025. It has long been the position of the Department of Justice that the United States Constitution forbids the federal indictment and subsequent criminal prosecution of a sitting President. But the Department and the country have never faced the circumstance here, where a federal indictment against a private citizen has been returned by a grand jury and a criminal prosecution is already underway when the defendant is elected President.

""Confronted with this unprecedented situation, the Special Counsel’s Office consulted with the Department’s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), whose interpretation of constitutional questions such as those raised here is binding on Department prosecutors. After careful consideration, the Department has determined that OLC’s prior opinions concerning the Constitution’s prohibition on federal indictment and prosecution of a sitting President apply to this situation and that as a result, this prosecution must be dismissed before the defendant is inaugurated.

""That prohibition is binding on the Department’s Special Counsel and applies regardless of the seriousness of the allegations or the procedural posture of the case. Accordingly, the Government respectfully moves for the dismissal of this case.""",Mon Nov 25 18:41:35 +0000 2024,0.12218045112781954,Support

What was the secret?

From the outside looking in, I can only assume but I think my assumptions won't be far off.

All legendary leaders have people around them that catch win of certain scenerios even within the enemy camp.

President Trump and his core team knew that his cabinet appointments won't be approved by the Senate knowing how the landscape is in the Senate and the House.

They knew all along and some citizens knew but the problem was that not enough people knew what the reality would be when his cabinet appointments go before the Senate.

People also don't understand the importance of public perception and support for certain key aspects of governance. The public does have the power to influence certain aspects of governance when it comes down to it.

If President Trump went straight for recess appointments, the media will start gaslighting like they always do and influence public perception which would potentially move the entire process into a tail spin which would delay quite a number of important policy moves.

Hence, Matt Gaetz comes into the picture.

The whole idea was to portray a picture of the reality that stares the America First Agenda in the face and the ramifications of not having a different approach to making things happen the way the people want.

Now the public knows thanks to @elonmusk and the X platform.

The real strategy and game plan began after Matt Gaetz stepped down from the appointment.

The core strategies will come in two parts but the assessments are happening daily and the approach will be tailored to cater for the desired outcomes.

Keep on watching the game plan. We will still win regardless of how the game goes.

They’ve had enough.

A movement in a myriad of rural counties across deep blue states such as Illinois and California to split off and form new states appears to be gaining some steam in the wake of the Nov. 5 election.

Conservative residents of the rural regions are taking note of their peers fleeing to lower-taxed and less-regulated red states but they are ready to stay put — pining for a divorce with the urban sectors of their state.

A group dubbed the New Illinois State has drafted a new constitution and championed plans to “Leave Illinois Without Moving.” On Election Day, seven rural counties in Illinois voted to contemplate splitting off from the state.

“There’s a lot of people in Chicago, and I think that they make a lot of decisions that affect people downstate,” Phil Gioja, from Iroquois County, told the Wall Street Journal.

“It’s just sending a message that, ‘Hey, you know, there’s people that would like to be part of the conversation, and often aren’t.’”

In Iroquois County, about 73% of voters backed the idea of banding together with other counties in Illinois, except Cook County, which encompasses Chicago and forming a new state. Chicago is home to about 40% of Illinois’ population.

While Gioja doesn’t anticipate a separation soon, some backers of a rural divorce think that an opening will come.

“We always believed that our best opportunity to negotiate our way out of Illinois was when Illinois was approaching that financial cliff — it’s been on a path toward it for years,” G.H. Merritt, who chairs New Illinois State told the outlet.

Out in California, a similar movement has taken root as well. The New California State organization hopes to splinter off the counties outside the Bay Area, Sacramento and Los Angeles.

“I’m so flipping excited,” Paul Preston, who founded New California State, told the Wall Street Journal.
