My mother, a two-time Trump voter in Florida, has moved closer to us in a safely blue state. While I don’t know what her vote was in the 2024 presidential election, it wouldn’t have affected the outcome.

I strongly oppose Trump, as do my wife and her family, who live nearby. I’m troubled by my mother’s support of someone I consider morally abhorrent and dangerous, especially when she voted in a former swing state.

With the result of the 2024 election, my wife and her family are directing their understandable fury at my mother. My wife’s sister said, ‘‘If she voted for Trump again, I’m completely done with her.’’

I expect that the next time they interact it will not be pretty. But my mother is a member of our family, and an invaluable caregiver to our children. She’s pleasant and kind in daily life and moved far from her home primarily for us and her grandkids.

And she is my mother, after all.

I appreciate the sacrifices my mother has made to be near our family and our children, and our kids love their grandma. But my wife and her family will be channeling their anger at one of the few Trump voters they personally know. And my mother expects me to intervene and speak up for her or to encourage my wife’s family to be more civil.

Ethically, is it wrong for me to hold my tongue or to try to negotiate the peace even though I agree with the substance of my wife’s family’s position?

If I try to protect my mother from vitriol, would I be betraying myself, or my wife and her family, in order to preserve harmony and child care?

If I try to completely opt out of having a role in this conflict, am I doing a disservice to all parties involved?

As a result, and according to figures from your country's Border and Customs Patrol (CBP), encounters at the border between Mexico and the United States have been reduced by 75% from December 2023 to November 2024. By the way, half of those who arrive do so through a legally granted appointment by the United States program called CBP One. For these reasons, caravans of migrants no longer arrive at the border. 

Even so, it is clear that we must jointly arrive at another model of labor mobility that is necessary for your country and to address the causes that lead families to leave their places of origin out of necessity.

He and his movement have succeeded in that regard, over the most severe reservations of just under half the country. In my opinion, it will bring a terrible and chaotic change that, in its blind zeal to upend, will actually rip away much of the institutional fabric and principled commitments that have made us the leader of the free world.

I hope I’m wrong. I hope the incompetence of Trump and those around him will limit the long-lasting damage his retributive and isolationist bent might inflict. And perhaps I’ll be doubly wrong and some of his chaos will actually have unforeseen benefits for the country. Perhaps we can muddle through and things will somehow snap back to some normalcy after what could be a lame-duck presidency. Perhaps. But it doesn’t feel that way. It feels like we’re spinning.

And muddling through was certainly not the story of Trump’s first term, which saw two impeachments, abuses of executive power, and a violent insurrection against the government. As a country, we’ve now effectively said none of that mattered. We’ve invited more. And we are permanently changed because of it.

UK's Guardian: 
""in most Western democracies, a felony conviction would be disqualifying in the eyes of voters, if not in the letter of the law.""
UK's The Telegraph:
""America gets a president with a rap sheet, and it is a national humiliation, and there will surely be violence.""
France's Le Monde: 
""the Republican Party's refusal to dump Trump as a candidate speaks to the ""moral and ethical degeneration of the party. 
Also, the Republican Senate's refusal to convict Trump of impeachment charges  following the Jan. 6 insurrection was a ""shocking display of partisanship over patriotism.""
Germany's Redaktions Netzwerk Deutschland: ""Trump should have been behind bars long ago, 
and that's an indictment of all American political institutions — and especially American voters, who continue to support him.""

Trump's re-election shows the world that a nation that is supposed to stand behind the rule of law doesn't really care about that anymore. 
It shows the world that Americans want to throw out democracy.

In 2016, 75% were shocked by Trump’s win—2024? Just 41%, a huge 34-point drop. 

Optimism made its debut this year at 50%, while pride (+8%) and excitement (+7%) also rose. 

Negative reactions like “devastated” (-5%) and “afraid” (-4%) slightly eased. 

Americans seem less rattled this time and more ready for round two.

🤔 Is this the ONLY question for illegals right now? 

President Trump's deportation policy stands as a beacon of strength in a world where our borders are disrespected. It's about reinstating the rule of law, prioritizing American workers, and safeguarding our national identity. Here's to bringing back the respect for our nation's laws and ensuring those who wish to partake in the American Dream do so by following our legal pathways.

Here are 20 who've facilitated this chaos:

✅ Joe Biden - ""No one will be punished for simply seeking a better life.""
✅ Kamala Harris - ""Do not come, do not come,"" while doing little to stop them.
✅ Alejandro Mayorkas - ""The border is closed, which has been misperceived to mean we are not allowing people in.""
✅ Nancy Pelosi - ""Sanctuary cities are a moral imperative.""
✅ Chuck Schumer - ""We're going to shut down the government if we don't get funding for DACA.""
✅ Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez - ""I think the policy is very inhumane and it needs to end.""
✅ Ilhan Omar - ""We must abolish ICE.""
✅ Rashida Tlaib - ""Abolish ICE and CBP and recognize that they are beyond repair.""
✅ Gavin Newsom - ""California is a sanctuary state.""
✅ Cory Booker - ""We must decriminalize border crossing.""
✅ Julian Castro - ""We should treat illegal entry as a civil, not criminal, offense.""
✅ Lori Lightfoot - ""Chicago remains a sanctuary city for those seeking refuge.""
Bill de Blasio - ""New York City stands as a beacon of hope for immigrants.""
✅ Muriel Bowser - ""D.C. will remain a sanctuary for those seeking safety.""
✅ ACLU - ""We intend to challenge any mass deportation effort.""
✅ United We Dream - ""We fight for a world where all immigrants have the opportunity to thrive.""
✅ La Raza - ""We work towards a society that respects the rights of all.""
✅ SPLC - ""We will continue to fight for immigrant rights.""
✅ Catholic Charities USA - ""We provide help and create hope for immigrants.""
✅ International Rescue Committee - ""We advocate for a more humane immigration system.""

The reality is that international relations and politics IS transactional. So journos and Galaxy Brains complain about Trump being transactional and all they are doing is revealing their stunning ignorance. The reality is China gets things done around the world because (and this is the hard part so follow me) it is willing to offer benefits to those who play along and harm those who don't. Having a beer with Olaf in Berlin to discuss German treason does not go nearly as far as imposing tangible pain to German interests if they refuse to cooperate in achieving US objectives.  Take yesterday's tariff announcement on Mexico to take a specific example.  It is well known that Mexico has refused to cooperate on a variety of issues such as immigration. So if they refuse to cooperate, you impose pain to make clear you can pursue policies in what you believe to be your best interest just as we can pursue policies we believe to be in our best interest. Let's see who wins this game. The key issue is that people need to believe you are credible in pursuing your threat and the threat needs to be big enough to change behavior. If they do not believe you are credible or the threat is not big enough, they will not change. In the faculty lounge this is referred to as the real politik v. liberalism theories.  Germany is going to pursue its self interest in free riding off the US as long as possible. We need to be willing to impose real costs on their strategy otherwise they will never change.

Let me take a fucking flamethrower to this garbage narrative. 

First off, the conflict of interest line is as played out as your sorry-ass excuses for actual policy debates. 

Yeah, Trump earned $160 million while president, because guess what little dumbass dwarf, he didn’t shut down his multi-billion-dollar businesses just because you decided to start hyperventilating. 

The man set up a revocable trust and handed control to his kids.

He legally distanced himself from running his companies during his presidency.

But sure, let’s ignore that little detail because it doesn’t fit your salty narrative.

You want to talk about conflict of interest? He didn’t have to give up shit, but he did, and he let his family manage the businesses while he focused on being the goddamn President of the United States. 

That’s right, a trust. Not like the shady-ass Clinton Foundation or the Biden family’s “art-dealing” racket that screams pay-to-play. Funny how none of you geniuses have a problem with those. 

Hypocrisy much?

And here’s a pro tip, Robert Reich (aka Captain Irrelevant): Running businesses while not actively managing them is not a conflict of interest; it’s called knowing how to delegate, something your bitter ass wouldn’t understand if it hit you in the face with a trust agreement. 

Maybe you should spend less time wailing about Trump and more time explaining why career politicians with no businesses or products magically end up multi-millionaires. 

Oh wait, that would point the finger at your own camp.

And as for this nut-clutching about ""foreign income,"" where’s that same outrage for politicians who pander to foreign donors, take money from shady NGOs, or set up foundations to launder influence cash?

Trump built his empire on his own, long before he even stepped foot in the White House. 

Compare that to career swamp rats who’ve done nothing but cash taxpayer-funded checks while selling out to the highest bidder.

Bottom line shorty: You don’t give a flying fuck about conflicts of interest. 

You’re just mad Trump didn’t bow to your cancel-happy mob and kept raking in dough while showing your favorite establishment puppets how it’s done. 

So, next time, maybe pick a fight that isn’t this laughably one-sided, because right now, you’re just swinging and missing like the amateur fuckwit midget that you are.

Oh and for those lurkers in the cheap seats, here's a bit more knowledge...

There’s no law, no constitutional clause, not even a dusty footnote in a government manual that says a U.S. president has to sell off their businesses or divest their assets when they take office. Zero. Zilch. Nada. 

The Emoluments Clause in the Constitution prohibits federal officials from receiving gifts, payments, or titles from foreign governments without Congress’s approval, but owning businesses doesn’t automatically violate that. 

The president isn’t even bound by the same conflict-of-interest laws as other government officials.

Let me fucking say that louder for the people in the back: 

The president is exempt from federal conflict-of-interest statutes.

Trump wasn’t breaking any laws by holding on to his businesses. What he did do, voluntarily, I might add, was set up a revocable trust and hand control of his companies to his family. 

He didn’t have to do that, but he did it anyway to avoid the kind of whining we’re seeing from people who probably couldn’t run a lemonade stand, let alone a billion-dollar empire.

In the past. Presidents have owned shit, farms, newspapers, businesses, while in office before. Hell, even George Washington owned a goddamn distillery while president.

Did he get accused of a conflict of interest for selling whiskey? 

Nope. So spare us the fake outrage.

Long story short: The only thing Trump had to do was comply with disclosure requirements and avoid direct management of his businesses while in office. And guess what? He did",Tue Nov 26 14:02:30 +0000 2024,0.004983211233211237,Support

""President-Elect Trump’s return is a wake-up call for Ottawa—a stark reminder that our economic reliance on American markets leaves us vulnerable to the whims of U.S. policy, where even the threat of tariffs can shake the very foundation of our food economy.""

Few political figures can wield as much influence over global markets as President-Elect Donald Trump. This week, his threats to impose sweeping new tariffs—25% on Canadian and Mexican agricultural products and an additional 10% on Chinese goods—sent shockwaves through currency markets, sinking the Canadian dollar by at least a cent within seconds. These tariffs, framed as leverage to secure tighter borders and reduce immigration and drug trafficking, represent more than just bluster; they signal a tactical shift in U.S. economic policy that could have devastating consequences for Canada’s agri-food sector.

In 2023, Canada exported over $40 billion worth of agri-food products to the United States, accounting for nearly 60% of its total agri-food exports. These exports span a diverse array of goods, including grains like wheat, canola, and barley; livestock such as beef and pork; seafood like lobster and snow crab; and fresh produce such as greenhouse-grown vegetables and berries. Iconic Canadian products like maple syrup and whisky, along with processed foods and pulses, further underscore Canada’s vital role in supplying high-quality agricultural goods to its largest trading partner.

A 25% tariff on these goods would be catastrophic, eroding the slim margins that underpin food production and trade. Food is a business of tight profit margins, and even a 5% tariff could disrupt supply chains, discourage U.S. importers, and upend decades of economic integration between the two countries. For Canadian producers, the stakes are especially high; we’ve never been so reliant on the American market since the early 2000s under George W. Bush, and Trump’s team knows it.

However, this is more about tactics than policy. President-Elect Trump is unlikely to enact measures that would harm American consumers. A tariff on $40 billion worth of Canadian food imports would undoubtedly inflate prices at U.S. grocery stores—a political risk Trump is keen to avoid. Instead, he’s betting Canada will yield under pressure, given our limited leverage and ongoing diplomatic tensions with other key markets, including India and China.

For Canada, this is a wake-up call. Ottawa must move beyond short-term measures like $250 rebate cheques or temporary GST holidays to address the structural vulnerabilities in our agri-food economy. Trump is simply doing what he promised: leveraging U.S. economic power to extract concessions.

Adding to Canada’s woes is the carbon tax, which has further weakened our agri-food sector’s competitiveness. A new peer-reviewed study from Dalhousie University shows that this policy has placed Canadian producers at a disadvantage relative to their U.S. counterparts. With the United States poised to withdraw from the Paris Agreement, American producers are free from similar constraints, giving them an edge in pricing and market access. Coupled with a weaker Canadian dollar, this could push food importers and retailers to favor U.S. products, leaving Canadian consumers to shoulder higher food costs.

If Canada continues to prioritize retail politics over meaningful economic strategy, the cost will be borne by every household at the grocery checkout. Trump’s tariff threats should not be dismissed as mere theatrics—they are a stark reminder of the fragile balance of power in North American trade. Ottawa must respond with a cohesive strategy to safeguard our agri-food sector and ensure it remains competitive in an increasingly hostile economic landscape.",Tue Nov 26 12:58:50 +0000 2024,0.04850413223140496,Support

""The point of what I was saying was I was wrong to lump in all Trump supporters as the same type of person. And I came to this realization and I'm embarrassed by what I previously thought of Trump supporters as like some monolith. 
I never made serious cash. I work at the Young Turks. Okay.  
I changed my mind on like a handful of policies, including policies pertaining to crime to some extent on, you know, immigration policy. I'm very much left wing and I've been critical of the Democratic Party for their economic policies being too pro-corporate.
And by the way, this is a comment not only to Laura Loomer, but also to the left, who engage in the purity stuff and don't like the fact that in the 18 years I've been here, yeah, I've changed my mind on a few issues.
Look, I see ordinary Americans as civilian. I see them as people who have the right to practice, you know, their own beliefs, to have their own opinions. And I am done with demonizing people based on how they vote, how they vote, or the reasons why they vote the way they do is complicated, right?
So for me to demonize them and to be hateful and divisive toward them doesn't really make sense. I have changed the way that I talk about people, ordinary people, and the way that I approach ordinary people that I disagree with because I want to understand them. And I see them as my fellow Americans, regardless of what their political ideology is.
That's what has changed with me.""

I’m writing an open letter to trump supporters. Please forgive my English as it is my second language. 

Dear MAGA, 

My friends, I have lived under a fascist regime as a teenager in my country of birth. Fascism is ain’t pretty. When the leader calls his fellow citizens enemies of the state, and calls for retribution, that’s fascism. The fear becomes crippling, because he constantly has to feed his supporters to stay in power at the expense of other citizens. He has identified liberals as enemies of our country. Heck, you all MAGAs, his supporters, call the liberals, the justice system and the politicians who were voted by citizens of the opposite party as enemies of the state. Trump has to put in place retributions to satisfy your appetite. He will. Cause you want him to do so. That’s fascism. Many of your fellow citizens under that threat, will wake up hoping it’s not their last day on earth. When knock on the door at neighbors house happens, your heart skip a beat with fear. Your friends disappear in broad daylight, but you’ll say the dear leader has to get rid of the bad apples. Pretty soon you’ll become that bad apple. I see your movement as fascism, Nazi like, because it’s all based on vengeance. Everything you couldn’t accomplish is the liberals and the deep dark liberal cabal state’s fault. You’ll soon discover that there was a bill of goods sold to you for them to gain power. Be a true patriot and reject any harm to your fellow citizens. Because you have the power.

Below I will discuss why ~100K was a highly asymmetric short set-up from my perspective. The punchline is that the market is highly (still) offside wrt being long

Since Trump's win, I have been carefully observing & monitoring flows with the belief that there would be an irrational rally of craving exposure. It was clear the day after Trump's win to me that getting long was the best risk-reward: 

a) irrationality would likely last for some time (although I did not suspect we could try for 100K so soon) and ,
b) if this was truly a regime shift than current levels (75K BTC / 2.7K ETH) would be highly constructive entries

Over the last few days, I surmised that that these flows showed early signs of exhaustion and we would tilted toward seeing a correction (independent of whether this was truly a regime shift or not), with whether or not we had surpassed 100K BTC being irrelevant. 

The main drivers of this are as following:
 
1. Very few people understand MSTR's financial structure and there was enough people that (wrongly) assumed his Convertible was not spent yet, and still, that his ATM offering was some boundless fountain of youth. Having done more work on MSTR than anyone else, I knew that every time he announces the 2nd closing of a convert - the buying finishes within a day or 2 of that usually. Saylor having done 4.6B between 11/11-11/17 with half of that this last week is showing clear signs of a slowdown. Most people do not comprehend that MSTR and ETF products are competing products - and the velocity of one also informs the other

2. Fidelity is actually the better vehicle to visualize retail demand ebbs & flows as IBIT is always lagging. During this last month and also in the original heated rally between February and March, Fidelity (being the 2nd largest month) has shown visibility around correcting pre-Trump and where there is a chop. Friday was the first non-starter day for Fidelity at a measly ~$20M with cum'l inflows excl. IBIT actually being negative. I suspect today's flows and tomorrow will show this 

3. Leverage creeping up insidiously (on-chain) but also across multiple assets - with 60%+ on memes and ETH/SOL being at 40% respectively (having creeped up in short, impulsive gaps in the evenings). During the Friday session, mostly everything had slowed with the absence of BTC (propelled entirely by Saylor)

4. Lack of short positioning - from watching books and rhetoric of people I watch, I surmised that people were very hesitant to short such a seemingly scary point (100K) and that this has largely invalidated shorts for most people who had stubbornly kept this positioning post-Trump. I felt that this was anchoring bias that would prevent new short OI from forming

5. Algo-led rallies with no spot follow-thru. Had noticed that a basket of 2021 alts (UNI, AVAX, COMP) had chosen to put in - all at the same time - 15% candles in the span of an hour after-hours on Friday. I do not view this move on OTHERS being sustainable especially now that we are back at March resistance of 325B+. I believed this would likely induce FOMO and leverage over the weekend, further creating the pinata to burst over this week as participants find themselves offside by lack of BTC strength

6. Utter complacency - over time, I noticed that first cyclers had gone from trying to call local tops in the first week to being silent, and then a growing union with very respected figureheads from previous cycles calling for higher, where the conversation had evolved from ""is the top here"" to ""I know what a top looks like and this is not it""

I believe the majority of these aspects are still in-play, with panic & indecision having not seeded itself yet. 

In my view this is still an area where people are in ""dip-buying"" mode, viewing this as an opportunity to gross up size in likely having missed the first part of this move starting at 75K+. The market has formed a dependance on 3B from ETFs + 5B from Saylor a week

Certainly at least some people will doubt whether or not I actually thought about the below in constructing a short or even being long - and so for for that reason I am making all recordings done over the last 2 weeks free (over the next 48H) - where I shared these ideas live. 

If you have the patience to audit then I am happy for these to be consumed: https://t.co/dMAux8SqPd
