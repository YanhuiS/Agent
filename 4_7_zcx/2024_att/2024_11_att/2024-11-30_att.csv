Have you been debanked?
Did a bank shut off your credit card use? 
Your banking? Your ability to get credit? 
Were you on their “debank” list and essentially the government shut you down via an entity (i.e. bank)!

Is this why Trump had a X Live Space (Aug 2024) talking about Crypto and how it bypasses the middle man (banks)? How buying a home or car can all be done from your “wallet”?

Today Trump talks about BRICS to use the dollar or it will get 100% tariffs! (I thought BRICS currency was part of the plan to get rid of the Federal Reserve).

Will banks eventually become irrelevant if people begin to use regulated crypto? Thereby bypassing banks? Will a strong dollar allow ppl to enrich themselves in purchasing power?

There seems to be zero fear of the Logan Act. Trump already appears to be handling foreign policy from Mar-a-Lago.

This leads me to believe that Trump is also in contact with Putin, likely trying to diffuse tensions.

If Trump is already handling foreign policy as President Elect, which he clearly is, it’s hard to imagine him NOT being in contact with Putin, given the Biden administration green-lighted firing missiles into Russia, are now trying to provide Ukraine with nuclear weapons, and are ultimately trying to bait Putin into a nuclear war.

Trump promised he would prevent WW3 and have the war in Ukraine stopped within 24 hours.

The only way he could do that, is by negotiating before he steps in office.

He has already spoken to Netanyahu, Orbán, Milei, Rutte, Zelensky, Trudeau, Macron, Duda, Sheinbaum, etc...

Why not Putin?

I don’t think it’s a stretch to assume Trump and Putin are in contact with one another in some capacity, but for strategic purposes, both parties are keeping their cards close to the vest.

The back channels are open, in hopes of staving off disaster.

TRANSFORMATION TEAM

You may have noticed Trump is already dealing with foreign leaders and implementing policy.

Trump is hitting the ground running, while the cries from the Dems and the corporate media are falling on deaf ears.

Trump is no longer hamstrung by optics. 

Trump has been unleashed.

Now that the corporate media have been completely discredited and the public are substantially more aware of our situation, Trump can actually do what is necessary without having to factor in backlash and the media whipping the public up into a frenzy. The public are no longer under the media brainwashing spell.

The only way justice could be administered, was AFTER we decentralized/defeated the media, and woke up a large enough portion of the public.

Now that the MSM are dead and The People are waking up, Trump can operate freely. 

Justice is possible.

Locals say everything is under 5 feet of water.

The house is a six bedroom, four bathroom farmhouse converted into a modern luxury home.

How could I undermine his effectiveness and superior governance or limit the positive impact he will achieve? 

I would focus on distracting his movement and creating fractures within it....

Silence Is Consent

I’m not new to this movement. I’ve been here since the beginning. The way I found Q, on its second post, was nothing short of a miracle. But let me tell you, this isn’t new to me. I’ve watched this movement grow, and I’ve watched it get shredded to pieces. And if we’re being honest, there’s a reason for that—a reason we need to face.

We didn’t take heed of what Q was really trying to tell us.

Was Q a psyop? Of course, it was. Disinformation and misinformation are necessary in an information war. Q even told us as much. But here’s the thing: while misinformation might be used to confuse the enemy, we—the people—aren’t supposed to spread false narratives, half-truths, or unchecked rumors. Our job is to dig, verify, and expel one thing ruthlessly: facts and truth.

The Weapons of Information War

The only weapon we have in this type of warfare is the truth. And we’re supposed to wield it mercilessly. That’s the entire point. Yet somewhere along the way, we lost that focus. We allowed bad actors, grifters, and chaos agents to twist this movement into something it was never supposed to be.

I’m not very well accepted in the Q community. In fact, I keep my connections small, and I’m okay with that. Most of the time, I prefer it that way. Most times I step into a space or a chat, conflict seems to follow me, and I don’t even have to say a word.",Sat Nov 30 16:44:18 +0000 2024,0.018560606060606073,Support

Six major banks, including JPMorgan, Bank of America, and Wells Fargo, filed over 170 Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) with the Treasury Department regarding the Biden family, alleging their involvement in money laundering, human trafficking, and tax fraud.

The banks also flagged wire transfers sent to the Bidens from foreign state-owned entities, raising concerns about money laundering and tax evasion. 

Investigations revealed that these foreign funds were funneled through 20 shell companies associated with Biden business partners before being distributed to nine Biden family members, including grandchildren.

Despite this, to my knowledge, not a single member of the Biden family has been debanked. For ordinary Americans, even a few SARs would likely result in debanking. Additionally, none of the Bidens registered under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA), as would typically be required in such circumstances.

Meanwhile, hundreds of cryptocurrency entrepreneurs and Trump supporters—including Melania and Barron Trump—have been debanked.

Just as the establishment weaponizes the U.S. dollar against foreign adversaries, it uses debanking as a weapon against its domestic opponents.",Sat Nov 30 17:51:35 +0000 2024,0.044175170068027216,Support

The People

Trump’s win is a win for the people of America. 🇺🇸

This election was a battle between the establishment's might and the indomitable will of the American voter. Despite the Democrats' control over every major institution meant to sway public opinion, the silent majority spoke louder than any media narrative or celebrity endorsement. This victory signifies a rejection of the globalist agenda in favor of national sovereignty, traditional values, and economic patriotism that Trump championed.

It's a testament to the resilience of the American spirit, showing that no amount of propaganda can drown out the voice of truth when it's backed by the people's desire for genuine change. This is the essence of MAGA - not just a slogan but a movement against the manipulation of our democratic processes.

It's like the Democrats are trying to divert attention and see who's the bigger victim.

Apologies for my skepticism, but I honestly don't believe them. Real Trump supporters have no reason to do this.

Where the fuck were these death threats in 2020 when there was more reason for them?

The FBI really sucks at what they do.

A lot of Trump and Q supporters aren’t actually “Trusting the Plan” anymore—they’re just too spineless to admit it. Why? Fear. Fear of being booted from their echo chambers. Fear of losing their little cult-approved camaraderie. Or maybe they’re just stuck between bad and worse—like choosing between shit and diarrhea. Spoiler alert: neither is appetizing, and if those are the options on the table, you better believe that’s by design.

Let’s face it—it’s a sad state of affairs when the “freedom movement” is made up of people too scared to voice their concerns. You know who else isn’t allowed to question leadership? Cult members. Halloooo 👋 

Here’s the reality: I’ve been dragged through the mud by the same cowards who preach about freedom but can’t handle an ounce of dissent. 
I say screw ‘em. 
Do what feels right for YOU. 
At the end of the day, you’re the one staring back at yourself in the mirror—not them. They never gave a damn about you anyway. All they wanted was the comfort of someone else validating their delusions and grifte. 

Stop being a pawn in their cowardly game. If this is about freedom, then act like it. Forget the backlash, do what’s right, and stand your ground—even if you’re alone. 
Fitting in with the mob isn’t freedom; it’s enslavement disguised as solidarity. 

Freedom means owning your voice, your choices, and your values—even when they put you at odds with the majority. 
It’s about standing firm when everyone else caves, because the moment you prioritize acceptance over truth, you forfeit your claim to liberty.
