My Take

The Treasury Secretary gets to sit in the room and opine on policy. And their voice will be taken seriously.

But they do not set the policy; the President does. When the president says what they will do, they expect the Treasury Secretary to sell that policy as if it were theirs.

The second part, selling something they don't believe in but are told to do, is something Jamie Dimon will never do, so he will never be the Treasury Secretary. (Dimon wants to tell everyone else what they should sell).

Lutnick will sell whatever you tell him and do it with gusto! Bessert will do so too, but he does not command the room like Lutnick.

In other words, the Treasury Secretary is the administration's chief spokesman. This is a sales job, and it needs a salesperson.

The problem with Yellen was that she needed to be a better salesperson. Yes, she is an outstanding economist, but she was never a good spokesperson for the Biden Agenda.

She would have been a better National Economic Council head, the ""smart person in the shadows advising the President.""

If I had to guess ....

Lutnick = Treasury Secretary
Bessert = National Economic Council head",Sat Nov 16 23:27:10 +0000 2024,0.12966269841269842,Support

During his first term, Trump enacted a so-called ‚Äúmaximum pressure‚Äù policy aimed at curbing Iran‚Äôs growing influence in the Middle East. 

Iran had grown much stronger after sanctions were lifted as part of the 2015 nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), negotiated by the Obama administration. 

Trump withdrew from this agreement in 2018. The US re-imposed severe sanctions on Iran and an embargo on its oil exports. This had severe impacts on Iran‚Äôs economy and contributed to social unrest within the country.

In January 2020, tensions between the US and Iran culminated in the assassination of Quds Force commander Qassem Soleimani by a US drone strike. This led to reprisal attacks by Iran on a US military base in Iraq.

In response to these mounting pressures, Iran scaled back its adherence to the JCPOA. It barredInternational Atomic Energy Agency inspectors from monitoring its nuclear program and enriched uranium to near-weapons-grade level.",Sat Nov 16 21:57:29 +0000 2024,0.03958333333333333,Support

I mean, categorically, the market has experienced two severe volatility spikes during his presidency (February 2018 and March 2020).

Political preferences aside, I believe we now have a fairly radical president with a red Senate, which makes it much easier to pass legislation. This comes at a time when the country is grappling with inflation and a significant long-term debt issue along with real rising social tensions. 

I am a Trader, so whatever the market gives me, I‚Äôm going to trade. However, I do believe the next four years will be favorable for volatility‚Äîvery different from what we‚Äôve seen in recent years. So yeah, I kinda think Trump will ultimately MVGA in the long run.

The posts clearly call into question whether this agent  can provide adequate protection to President-elect Trump during the transition of power, the inauguration, and afterward. The agent, from what I've been told, has about six years of experience and is in Phase 2 of his career and is assigned to Vice President Kamala Harris's protective detail.   

After internet sleuths and an online publication called https://t.co/OT0uSGTUdc published details of what they described are the agent's online posts, a Secret Service spokesman tells me that agency officials heard about the accusations and have ""modified"" the agent's duties and launched an internal probe into the social media posts.  

‚ÄúThe U.S. Secret Service recently became aware of alleged social media posts by an employee that have prompted an internal review,"" Secret Service spokesman Anthony Gugilielmi tells me in a statement. ""We are taking this matter seriously, and this employee's assigned duties have been modified while this review is underway.""    

""These comments in no way represent the views or values of the Secret Service, and we maintain and enforce rigorous codes of conduct governing employee actions both on and off duty,"" he added.   

After the social media posts came to light, the agent deleted his accounts so any internal agency review would need to verify those deleted accounts as his. 

That's apparently why he hasn't been disciplined more severely and swiftly, although there's a precedent, which I describe below, for disciplining agents while continuing to pay them until they hit certain retirement dates so they can retire with full pay and retirement benefits.   

The controversy over the agent's anti-Trump social media posts as the nation prepares for a transfer of power to Trump echo a similar incident in early 2017, just before Trump's first inauguration. At that time, a senior female agent, Kerry O'Grady, suggested in an October 2016 Facebook post that she didn't want to take a bullet for Trump if he was elected. I broke that story in early 2017.  O'Grady was the leader of the Denver Field Office at the time.   O'Grady was not disciplined for the Facebook post until after I wrote this piece:  

https://t.co/Ipu1VadqJ4‚Ä¶ 

The Secret Service placed her on paid administrative leave for more than two and a half years, giving her what amounted to a paid vacation until she reached a retirement milestone in early 2019 even though she had reached her settlement with the Department of Homeland Security in Oct. 2017.   Here's that store that I wrote in 2019:  

https://t.co/YQXn33PDrD‚Ä¶ https://t.co/xIXewAvREy has described the agent who made the Nazi references about Trump and his supporters as a devout follower of ""antifascist shock jock Robert Evans."" 

Evans, a former editor at the humor website https://t.co/mt1L5jt7Pv, has written for an online outlet called Bellingcat and has operated several podcasts. In mid-2020, Evans joined a class-action lawsuit against the City of Portland for police use of force against the Antifa-led protests responding to the death of George Floyd.  

The issues surrounding the latest accusations related to an agent's inappropriate online media posts raises serious and ongoing questions about the internal vetting and hiring standards at the Secret Service. Historically, USSS leadership handled hiring decisions, but in recent years human resource officials with no protective experience in the agency have been making the hiring decisions with DEI priorities taking precedent over other security qualifications/experience, according to several sources in the Secret Service community.   

I'm told the agency, over the last decade, has dramatically lowered standards for drug use and physical fitness issues that previously would have been disqualifying. The agency also doesn't require mental health screening for prospective recruits, an issue that several whistleblowers have repeatedly raised a problem in an era marked by lower hiring standards.  

I've been working on this story all week, but @AMrAndyNgo,  an intrepid reporter who provided outstanding coverage of the 2020 Antifa riots in Portland and Seattle was able to break the issue about the agent's alleged social media posts late Friday afternoon, citing ""internet sleuths"" who first discovered the incendiary online comments.",Sat Nov 16 18:27:54 +0000 2024,0.004543650793650797,Support

The posts clearly call into question whether this agent  can provide adequate protection to President-elect Trump during the transition of power, the inauguration, and afterward. The agent, from what I've been told, has about six years of experience and is in Phase 2 of his career is assigned to Vice President Kamala Harris's protective detail. 

After internet sleuths and an online publication called https://t.co/imQ8ud8GjC published details of what they described are the agent's online posts, a Secret Service spokesman tells me that agency officials heard about the accusations and have ""modified"" the agent's duties and launched an internal probe into the social media posts.

‚ÄúThe U.S. Secret Service recently became aware of alleged social media posts by an employee that have prompted an internal review,"" Secret Service spokesman Anthony Gugilielmi tells me in a statement. ""We are taking this matter seriously, and this employee's assigned duties have been modified while this review is underway.""  

""These comments in no way represent the views or values of the Secret Service, and we maintain and enforce rigorous codes of conduct governing employee actions both on and off duty,"" he added. 

After the social media posts came to light, the agent deleted his accounts so any internal agency review would need to verify those deleted accounts as his. That's apparently why he hasn't been disciplined more severely and swiftly, although there's a precedent, which I describe below, for disciplining agents while continuing to pay them until they hit certain retirement dates so they can retire with full pay and retirement benefits. 

The controversy over the agent's anti-Trump social media posts as the nation prepares for a transfer of power to Trump echo a similar incident in early 2017, just before Trump's first inauguration. At that time, a senior female agent, Kerry O'Grady, suggested in an October 2016 Facebook post that she didn't want to take a bullet for Trump if he was elected. I broke that story in early 2017.  O'Grady was the leader of the Denver Field Office at the time. 

O'Grady was not disciplined for the Facebook post until after I wrote this piece: 
https://t.co/4TlTDHkCyn

The Secret Service placed her on paid administrative leave for more than two and a half years, giving her what amounted to a paid vacation until she reached a retirement milestone in early 2019 even though she had reached her settlement with the Department of Homeland Security in Oct. 2017. 

Here's that store that I wrote in 2019: 
https://t.co/kPsa2QpC6A

https://t.co/xIXewAwpu6 has described the agent who made the Nazi references about Trump and his supporters as a devout follower of ""antifascist shock jock Robert Evans."" Evans, a former editor at the humor website https://t.co/mt1L5jtFF3, has written for an online outlet called Bellingcat and has operated several podcasts. In mid-2020, Evans joined a class-action lawsuit against the City of Portland for police use of force against the Antifa-led protests responding to the death of George Floyd.

The issues surrounding the latest accusations related to an agent's inappropriate online media posts raises serious and ongoing questions about the internal vetting and hiring standards at the Secret Service. Historically, USSS leadership handled hiring decisions, but in recent years human resource officials with no protective experience in the agency have been making the hiring decisions with DEI priorities taking precedent over other security qualifications/experience, according to several sources in the Secret Service community. 

I'm told the agency, over the last decade, has dramatically lowered standards for drug use and physical fitness issues that previously would have been disqualifying. The agency also doesn't require mental health screening for prospective recruits, an issue that several whistleblowers have repeatedly raised a problem in an era marked by lower hiring standards.

I've been working on this story all week, but @AMrAndyNgo,  an intrepid reporter who provided outstanding coverage of the 2020 Antifa riots in Portland and Seattle was able to break the issue about the agent's alleged social media posts late Friday afternoon, citing ""internet sleuths"" who first discovered the incendiary online comments.",Sat Nov 16 18:24:41 +0000 2024,0.004543650793650797,Support

Ripple's XRP token is up over 30% in the past 24 hours, and broke the $1 mark for the first time in three years, driven by optimism around regulatory changes and the SEC's mounting legal issues.

The SEC initiated a lawsuit against Ripple in 2020, claiming Ripple sold XRP as an unregistered security.

A recent lawsuit filed by state attorneys general and the DeFi Education Fund accuses the SEC of overreach, potentially influencing its appeal in the Ripple case. 

Plus, anticipation of pro-crypto policies under Trump has further boosted sentiment, with speculation about a more favorable regulatory environment for the Ripple and it's XRP token.

Open interest in XRP futures also hit a record $1.53 billion, validating the price rally.

Bad policy at The FCC could cripple free speech and independent media while destroying companies like X and Starlink in a regulatory death-spiral.

This is why I am endorsing Brendan Carr for Chairman of the FCC. Brendan is a fierce Constitutional advocate for free expression and truth. As FCC Chairman he would crush the political bias and censorship industry along with the regulatory cartel stifling new technology and innovation. Brendan would *actually* expand blazing fast WiFi for Americans and scrutinize old deals that benefit DC Super-donors over real Americans. Most importantly, Brendan sees the future of communication America as driven by *more* freedom and less control in DC.

Brendan currently serves as an FCC Commissioner appointed by Trump. I hope Trump elevates @BrendanCarrFCC to Chairman so he can get to work bulldozing old broken censorship systems and usher in a new Golden Age of free speech.

Merely a year ago or less, Ukrainian officials and Kiev's staunchest supporters essentially considered it 'treason' to even broach the possibility of peace talks with Russia. President Zelensky himself had frequently made it clear that he would not consider it so long as Putin is in power.

But on Friday, Zelensky issued some remarks which constitute a glaring 180-degree reversal, in the wake of Trump's election victory, on the prospect of peace in Ukraine. Zelensky stated that under the Trump administration ""the war will end faster"". He laid out the following in a fresh interview, according to a regional source:

""It is very important for us to have a just peace, so that we do not feel that we have lost our best because of the injustice that has been imposed on you. The war will end, but there is no exact date. Certainly, with the policies of this team that will now lead the White House, the war will end sooner. This is their approach, their promise to their society, and it is also very important to them,"" he said.

As for the earlier Putin-Scholz phone call, it ended on a note that the two leaders should talk again soon. Their discussion has been described as ""frank"" and ""detailed"" concerning the Ukraine conflict. Putin conveyed to the German leader that Russia-German relations have seen ""unprecedented degradation""¬†- according to TASS.

Below is the call summary/readout from the Russian side:

""The chancellor and the Russian president agreed to stay in contact from now on. The German government will ensure that allies and partners, as well as the EU and NATO leadership are informed,"" the source said.

In addition to the information released by the German government's press service after the conversation, the source said that Scholz expressed concern over reports about the alleged deployment of North Korean servicemen to Russia. According to him, this could allegedly lead to ""a significant escalation and expansion of the conflict.""

And most importantly the two expressed a desire for formal Ukraine talks:

Russia is open to talks to settle the conflict in Ukraine based on the proposals that were announced at the Foreign Ministry in June, Russian President Vladimir Putin told German Chancellor Olaf Scholz as they spoke by phone, the Kremlin said.

""As for the prospects for a political and diplomatic settlement of the conflict, the Russian president noted that the Russian side has never refused and remains open to the resumption of the negotiations that were interrupted by the Kiev regime,"" the Kremlin said in a statement. ""Russia's proposals are well known and outlined, in particular, in a June speech at the Russian Foreign Ministry.""

All of this - especially Zelensky's apparent change of heart (or else realization that the war is unwinnable at this point) - points to strong momentum that talks could get underway before Trump is even sworn in on Jan.20. Zelensky, when he last met Trump in New York, had described that Ukraine has ""been through hell"".

They become angry, defensive and tribal. 
What's even more confusing to them is the quality and caliber of people speaking out against Trump and his picks for his administration. 

These are not liberals, not woke people, not Democrats. These are traditionally conservative and Republican voting people and serious people at that. High profile people that gained respect throughout other administrations and people respected for their analysis on politics and war.

As soon as these MAGA and Trump supporter types see ANY hint of criticism of Trump they unfollow as if they can't even be bothered to see what the shift is about, to see what the fuss is about. 

I'd ask them to be a little less prideful, stop considering that you know it all, entertain what it is we are upset about. Not everything is an, ""us or them,"" argument. It dosen't mean we're upset because we all were always against Trump, many of us, including myself were extremely pro-Trump. 

It's not even about his policy here at home, or that we favor Democrats. It's really not about anything else other than his stance on Israel and Jewish people. It would seem insane for one issue to garner such backlash, and maybe that's why you are confused. I think mostly because you don't understand how massive of an issue that it is. 

That the people he appoints, the people governing us are not loyal to America, it is Israel they serve and as has in the past, will likely lead us to war for them once again. Its about Jewish and Israeli occupation of our media, entertainment, news outlets of all kinds, government and all affected areas. It's about funding and supporting genocide and occupation. 

And to have a president that favors and supports this, and appoints those whom also do is incredibly un-American and definitely not America First . 

I think maybe MAGA find themselves in love with the man, as opposed to what he says and does. A kind of, ""Trump no matter what, regardless of the outcome."" 
It screams of a stubbornness, to ignore and not recognize very dangerous things happening just so you can win, or to be right. 

When such a large number of people are growing to speak out against Trump, it may be time to actually look into it and not just assume everyone else is stupid for not thinking as you do. 

If I'm in Spain and I see people running in mass, I'm going to run also, at least to a point where I can get a good view and see why. 

Because there may just be a bull.

I get it that Trump won a mandate. However, he didn‚Äôt win a mandate because of YOU. He won a mandate because a broad coalition of people- right, center-right, moderate, and independent - voted for him. And they voted for him because there was one issue that united them - the prices were too high, the border was too broken, and the world was too unstable. They didn't vote for Trump because they suddenly understood the hidden genius behind being a jerk, of fell in love with it. They voted for him because they thought he could do the job better.
American people want one thing from their president ‚Äì do your fricking job. You were hired to fix the border, improve the economy, and stop the wars. You were not hired to return favors and entertain your clan. When American people realize ‚Äúbait and switch‚Äù was made, and they elected a shock jock instead of a problem solver, they will be very angry.
You must understand that Trump is there for 4 years only. There is nothing in this for him but glory. But if he fails to deliver, Republican party will be in shambles the same way Democrats are now, and they won‚Äôt be put together for a decade, while Trump laughs all the way to the bank and you cry that he wasn‚Äôt successful because his cabinet picks weren‚Äôt approved and blame ‚ÄúRINOs,‚Äù or ‚Äúglobalists,‚Äù or Soros, or whoever. You blamed everyone and their drunk cousin when Trump failed, and you will not change.
For the Senators, you face a dilemma: to bow down to a very popular movement, or to look to your future. Remember, you also have a mandate. Your mandate given to you by the Constitution is to put a check on the executive branch. If you operate the way Democrats operate, by crushing opposition, then you are no better than Democrats and your mandate will be stripped in 2 years. I know Charlie Kirk has a megaphone right now, but there are a lot of people who don‚Äôt, and we also vote.

*Dear Donald, Robert and Dmitry,
@realDonaldTrump @RobertKennedyJr @MedvedevRussiaE  are you all against the 1st Amendment? 
Are you all Bolsheviks in disguise? 
Am I not allowed to say jews were behind the massmurder of 66 million Russian, Ukrainian, Kosak and other Orthodox Christians and Muslims and responsible for the bloodlust and genocide on 12 million Germans from 1945 - 1948? 
Sadly it took US Military Police 3 years to make crime scene investigations in all the KZ Camps and found ""no poison gas was used in any of the camps"" and ""the next former camp-inmate -particularly of jewish descent- that claim poison gas was used will be taken to court charged with perjury"" as they wrote in a public statement. That stopped the rampant killing, torture, rape and looting of Germans, well at least in the Western part of Germany.
Am I not allowed to quote the US Military Police and say that there is NO evidence poison gas was used against a single jew?
What about the management of Auschwitz and Majdanek KZ Camp museums?
They have revised the fake number of respectively 4 million and 2 million down to half a million and 30.000, are they ""holocaust deniers""?
They just chopped off over 5,5 million of the Big Lie!
Should they be jailed?

My take:
It is not West versus East. 
It is you the establisment, globalists, governments, mass media and educational system versus the people. 
I hope the three of you are real reformers. 
I don't have to prove myself, but you all do. 
Protecting a supremacist dystopian zionist death cult disqualifies you from working for the people. 
We are facing a global conspiracy of a very very evil tribe with a religious book that is the most satanic ever written. That would be the Talmud. That tribe has infiltrated all governments in the world, it has taken over the control of the money creation and uses it to bribe politicians, academics, movie executives and journalists to peddle their world views and global psyops, that all lead to a dystopian dictatorship in accordance with The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion, Coodenhove-Kalergi's book Praktischer Idealmus, where he writes that white people shall be breed out through mass immigration of black and brown people and only the jews shall stay racially pure, and the jews shall rule all the Western countries. As we see right in front of our eyes happening. 
It is also in accordance with Anatolij Golitsyns New Lies for Old where he predicted 60 years ago what has happend with a 95% accuracy, the planned zionist/Bolshevik infiltration in all our various parts of society, government, media, education, movies, this would lead to the demoralisation of the population in the West, feminism, atheism, break up of the family unit, destruction of our value system, culture and traditions. 

I SINCERELY HOPE you three are not agents for the Dark Side.
