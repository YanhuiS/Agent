She no longer lives in the United States. The Hollywood B-list celebrity splits time between living in Spain and Mexico.

Longoria says she‚Äôs concerned about Americans who can‚Äôt ‚Äúescape‚Äù their ‚Äúdystopian country.‚Äù Trump hasn't even been sworn into office yet.

‚ÄúThe shocking part is not that he won,‚Äù Longoria told Marie Claire.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs that a convicted criminal who spews so much hate could hold the highest office,‚Äù she said.

Donald Trump is not a convicted felon unless he is sentenced. Judge Juan Merchan has postponed sentencing in the ""hush money"" case. 

Longoria campaigned¬†for Vice President Harris and spoke at the Democratic National Convention.

‚ÄúI would like to think our fight continues,‚Äù she said. But, ‚ÄúIf he keeps his promises ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs going to be a scary place.‚Äù

Most Americans do not consider securing the border, ending foreign wars, and fixing the economy to be ""scary,"" however.

Longoria claim that she has made her ""escape"" from America.

""I‚Äôm privileged,‚Äù Longoria. ‚ÄúI get to escape and go somewhere. Most Americans aren‚Äôt so lucky. They‚Äôre going to be stuck in this dystopian country, and my anxiety and sadness is for them.""

Eva Longoria is yet another condescending Hollywood elite who doesn't get America.

With lessons for Democrats and low fertility countries everywhere!

In the 2024 US presidential election, one of the most prominent features was the very large family gap between states won by Trump and states won by Harris -- red states have far higher fertility. X user Charlie Smirkley observed that ‚ÄúThe hypothetical 0% Trump share state would have a TFR of 1.04. For a state with a 100% Trump share, the TFR would be 2.20.‚Äù

Given this large and persistent difference, Democratic states really need to need to boost birth rates or else be left behind politically. But what is behind this enormous gap? There are several factors that matter a great deal for birthrates, and Republicans do much better on all these factors than Democrats. Let‚Äôs explore:

Pronatal Beliefs
The first driver of birthrates is simply fertility preferences: How many children do people want to have? This in turn is driven by views around children. How important are families? Are low birthrates a problem or a good thing?

I showed in a recent thread how beliefs around children have a big impact on fertility.
https://t.co/zGVcDRLEqt
In 2023, Pew Research surveyed Americans about their views around family, and they asked several questions about pronatal views, such as whether people having fewer children is negative or positive. It turns out that there are big differences between Republicans and Democrats, with Republicans having markedly more positive views about the importance of children for America‚Äôs future.

This is area where things can really change. A lot of people do not yet grasp that low birthrates are a serious problem. When they do, many will want to do their part by having more children.

Religiosity
Overwhelmingly, studies show a strong positive relationship between religious belief and attendance, and fertility.
https://t.co/PDgaxUQd22

Is there a difference in religiosity between Democrats and Republicans? Yes, a big one! Republicans are much more likely to have religious belief than Democrats and are more likely to attend religious services.

Density and housing type
In general, density and crowding are quite negative for birthrates. This is plain both from a review of the literature around fertility and from maps of fertility around the around the world.
https://t.co/0qxZlMvNPS
https://t.co/zehjWlSRga
Given the large ‚Äòland gap‚Äô between Democrats and Republicans, where Democrats tend to crowd in and around cities while Republicans tend to spread out across the land, it is no surprise that the latter would have much higher birthrates.
Republican areas tend to have much cheaper housing because of less expensive land and because they tend to have fewer restrictions on building. But also, in cities where Democrats tend to live there is a high prevalence of apartment living, which is itself less favorable to family life.

Marriage
Until about 1980, there was little difference between Republicans and Democrats in marriage rates. Both tended to marry at very high rates. But these days, less than half of Democrats ages 30-50 are married, while more than 2/3 of Republican are.
This matters greatly for fertility, since people who are married are much more likely to have children than those who are not.

Lessons for Blue States and Low Birthrate Countries
What can blue states (and low birthrate countries) learn from red states about how to have higher birthrates?

¬∑ Develop pronatal belief. That means building awareness of low birthrates as a problem and speaking positively rather than negatively about population. People really do adjust their fertility preferences according to these ideas!
¬∑ Value religion more. Faiths should not be dismissed backwards, especially in a world of plunging birthrates. They are often the biggest driver of family formation.
¬∑ Build more housing, but of a type that is right for families. Mainly that means opening new land for more suburbs. A lot of blue states, such as California and Oregon, have plenty of unused land, but they prohibit building on it.
https://t.co/vbJNnzLmEn
¬∑ Encourage marriage in culture. University of Maryland economist Melissa Kearney explains that those left rarely want to talk about the benefits of marriage for families, because such talk is coded as right-wing. That taboo is costly and needs to be discarded.

Republican leaning states in the US are doing comparatively well demographically and may come to dominate Democrat leaning states if these trends continue. It would be better for those states and better for America if they could raise their fertility, by following those states that already have this figured out.

Meanwhile, countries struggling with low birthrates would be well advised to follow the red state model to higher birthrates.

[You have said that Trump‚Äôs accession to power will not change the US policy in Ukraine. Do you still think so, or should we take into account the new appointments in the Trump administration, some of them people who have been speaking about Ukraine fatigue and putting an end to funding? Donald Trump has even said that the United States might leave NATO. What do you think about the possibility of a settlement in Ukraine under the Trump administration?]

""Essentially, Washington‚Äôs position on Ukraine and Europe will not change in that the United States will always try to control everything in the region around NATO and NATO itself.

The EU has become a kind of NATO in the military-political sense.

I won‚Äôt try to guess how they would do this and how they would maintain control in the new conditions.

Forms can vary. But I have no doubt whatsoever that they will try to control these processes.

Some people have taken a more reasonable view of the situation in Ukraine, saying that a great deal has been lost and this loss will never be recovered, and so a freeze would be a solution in this situation.""

[Donald Trump has said that he will have it solved in 24 hours.]

""That‚Äôs not what I‚Äôm talking about. I don‚Äôt want to focus on that.

Those who now claim that they have made a U-turn and want to stop the war are actually talking about operations on the line of contact and a 10-year truce, after which they would look at what could be done.

But this is just another version of the Minsk Agreements, or even worse.

The Minsk Agreements were the final solution, but they didn‚Äôt bother to accept them as such.

To tell the truth, these agreements concerned a small part of Donbass.

But it has not come about because Zelensky, and Petr Poroshenko before him, were categorically against giving that part of Donbass a special status with a right to speak the native language.

That part of Donbass would have remained Ukraine.

The West swallowed that, despite our numerous arguments about the root causes of the conflict, including the drawing of Ukraine into NATO and the deliberate legislative elimination of everything Russian.

This programme is too short to enumerate all the laws that prohibited Russian language education, media and cultural events, not to mention the ban on using Russian in everyday life.

Nobody there takes this into account.

None of the Republicans who are voicing what is described as 'revolutionary ideas' for ending the Ukraine conflict have said that people in Ukraine must regain their right to speak, receive education themselves and ensure the same for their children, as well as have access to information in the Russian language.

We have said this on numerous occasions, and we will continue to do it.

The Western architects of a settlement in Ukraine have no regard for that.

In my opinion, this means that no US administration is different.

They feel good when Russia and its influence are weakened. This also applies to the Russian World.

Everything they do is ultimately aimed at suppressing Russia as a competitor.

The Americans announced long ago that no state in the world must become more influential than the United States.

That is the real reason.

Their attitude to the Russian language, which is a vital human right, is very telling in this respect.""

[Elon Musk has already got his appointment within the Donald Trump administration. Could this pave the way or lay the groundwork for a new kind of thinking?]

On Capitol Hill, Rubio is the vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee and a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He will target TikTok once again, but this time he will get the app completely banned based on his anti-China lies. 

Let's not forget that China in past placed sanctions on Rubio because of his anti-China mission. 

Fact of the matter is Rubio & Gabbard are the worst possible pics dealing with China!

Florida‚Äôs Attorney General Ashley Moody has filed a lawsuit against FEMA, claiming the agency discriminated against Trump supporters in providing hurricane relief.

This follows an incident where a FEMA employee directed aid teams to avoid homes displaying Trump campaign signs. 

The employee, Marn‚Äôi Washington, was later fired, but she alleges she was scapegoated for a broader agency practice.

The lawsuit comes as Florida faces ongoing hurricane recovery efforts.

Since Tocqueville, it‚Äôs been clear that Americans need that kind of relationship toward their tech to ensure it serves them well, neither a dynamism-sapping master nor an abuse-arousing slave. 

Writ large, this balanced point of well-disciplined freedom is essential to life in an age of abundance, in which temptations and pitfalls can be as abundant as possibilities and pleasures. In financial, economic, and political life, it conduces to a healthy degree of leverage, neither catastrophically too much nor catatonically too little. 

And, at its best, it reminds us to seek ultimate balance, health, and source not in the material world but in that of the spirit. 

Right now, we inherit a socioeconomic order badly out of balance ‚Äî and, to mix metaphors, dug into a deep hole. Spiritually and practically, we must make haste to rise up from institutionalized paralysis and delusion, setting our country and ourselves back on a footing to build wisely and well on foundations of rock, not sand.

Doing so now requires a full-spectrum approach across tech, governance, economics, finance, infrastructure, and geopolitics ‚Äî the best efforts of our rising generations. However competent and ambitions, if this effort is soulless, it will fail. But competent ambition is necessary to ensure our country and its people do not face a dizzying fall from the overleveraged heights of today‚Äôs crumbling legacy regime.

In this regard, the intersection of tech and governance is where the rubber meets the road. And, fortunately, a critical mass of rising talents and experienced practitioners is ready to level up and do their duty.

That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm honored to @JoinFAI and its tremendous team as a nonresident senior fellow. In recent years, the Foundation for American Innovation has demonstrated the depth and breadth of reach ‚Äî working publicly and behind the scenes ‚Äî needed to make good on Tocqueville‚Äôs counsel of disciplined freedom as the leading edge of America‚Äôs dynamic advance across the whole frontier of the always-uncertain future. 

FAI‚Äôs community is ideal for developing more books like Human Forever, more ideas and initiatives around digital rights and Bitcoin, and more of the essential dialogue among those in tech and governance who understand both the gravity and the levity of this moment. I look forward to it all, and I hope you do too. üá∫üá∏",Thu Nov 14 16:41:44 +0000 2024,0.22780448717948718,Support

Perhaps as a threat of what‚Äôs to come, on Friday, supporters of President-elect Donald Trump recirculated a video statement on X that he made last year on transgender issues. In it, he pledges to stop federal backing for programs that support the concept of gender transition at any age and to ban gender-affirming care for minors. Any hospital that performs gender surgery on young people would be ejected from Medicare and Medicaid. He would cut federal funds to schools that tell children ‚Äúthey could be trapped in the wrong body,‚Äù and get a law that bars ‚Äúmen from participating in women‚Äôs sports.‚Äù

And it wasn‚Äôt just one video ‚Äî Trump made his intentions clear throughout the campaign, and he won handily.

During the closing weeks of the election, Republican campaigns spent over $65 million on ads ridiculing, among several candidates, Kamala Harris for supporting ‚Äútaxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners‚Äù and ‚Äúillegal aliens,‚Äù all ending with variations on the tagline: ‚ÄúKamala Harris is for they/them. President Trump is for you.‚Äù

At campaign events Trump attacked the idea of letting transgender girls and women play on female sports teams, and implied that children were having gender surgery in classrooms.

‚ÄúCan you imagine you‚Äôre a parent and your son leaves the house,‚Äù he said at a rally in Wisconsin, ‚Äúand you say, ‚ÄòJimmy, I love you so much, go have a good day in school,‚Äô and your son comes back with a brutal operation?‚Äù

Why did Trump and his allies devote so much attention and resources to something that seemingly affects a small number of people compared with top voter concerns like immigration, the economy, crime, abortion and democracy? Maybe because it worked. According to Harris‚Äôs leading super PAC, viewers shifted2.7 percentage points toward Trump after watching one of these ads.

Clearly it helped paint Harris as a radical leftist, out of step with most of America. But as those of us who opposed Trump lick our wounds and take stock, it‚Äôs worth considering why these ads and rally cries resonated.

It is not because most Americans are bigots or haters or anti-L.G.B.T.Q. people. But many voters, including liberals and Democrats, disagree with positions Harris and the Democratic Party have taken on transgender issues. Polls show that most voters, while largely supportive of existing legal rights and protections for transgender people, have complicated views on other policies that fall under the umbrella of what‚Äôs commonly referred to as trans rights.

Trump‚Äôs charge that children are undergoing gender transition surgeries in school is obviously absurd. But his words may have struck a chord with those who disagree with school districts that have teachers and administrators hide from parents that their children have adopted new gender identities. As The Times reported last year, one mother of a 15-year-old only accidentally discovered her child‚Äôs public school had been covering up the fact that for six months, her child had been going by a new name and using the boys‚Äô bathroom.

In recent years, the concepts of gender identity and the possibilityof being born in the wrong body have been introduced as early as elementary school. But a Washington Post poll found that 77 percent of Americans do not want teachers discussing these ideas in kindergarten through third grade and more than half oppose trans identity being talked about even in middle school.

The Democratic Party‚Äôs platform includes a pledge to defend gender-affirming care for minors. For people who are not well versed in the issue, this may sound like therapy to make children feel comfortable in their bodies; what it usually means in practice is allowing children to adopt a new name and pronouns, and in many cases, enabling them to change their bodies to resemble that of the opposite sex. This process can include puberty-blocking drugs, cross-sex hormones and, in some cases, surgery. More than 14,000 American children had gender-related medical interventions between 2019 and 2023.

While much of Europe has been pulling back from the gender-affirmation model, evidence has emerged that in the United States, proponents of this approach have let politics color science.

To cite two recent examples, one prominent advocate of gender-affirming care suppressed her own government-funded researchbecause she feared it might be ‚Äúweaponized‚Äù against her agenda, The Times reported. Meanwhile, Rachel Levine, the assistant secretary of health and human services chosen by President Biden, worked to get a transgender organization to remove age limitsfrom its proposed guidelines for surgeries, including mastectomies and hysterectomies for minors, because she said they would give fuel to political foes, according to recently released court documents. After this disclosure, the Biden administration released a statement saying it opposed such surgeries for minors.

Yet the Department of Health and Human Services continues to say that gender-affirming care is ‚Äúcrucial‚Äù for young people and ‚Äúhas been shown to increase positive outcomes for transgender and nonbinary children and adolescents‚Äù ‚Äî even though the most comprehensive overview of research, which assessed all major American and global studies on the subject, found scant evidence of this. Even so, all the leading American medical associations continue to back gender-affirming care.

In my reporting, I‚Äôve spoken with many parents of gender-dysphoric kids, overwhelmingly liberal and Democrat, who told me they felt betrayed by Democrats and by the Biden administration on this issue. They resent being labeled ‚Äúanti-trans‚Äù for questioning whether it‚Äôs right to simply accept what their children say about their gender, especially since those children often suffer from other mental health issues.

The number of people identifying as transgender is still tiny, but it is growing rapidly. While surveys show around 1 percent of American adults overall identify as transgender or nonbinary (meaning they choose not to identify as either sex), according to one poll, about 5 percent of adults younger than 30 now do.

Democratic politicians, the media and elite institutions frequently refer to our ‚Äúevolving understanding of sex and gender.‚Äù But a majority of Americans still believe that gender is based on sex at birth.

This is not because Americans are ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù with the existence of transgender people or need to get with the program. About 44 percent of Americans already know someone who is transgender. Indeed, polls show that people have become less supportive of progressive ideas about gender identity as they have become more widely publicized and understood. According to Pew,60 percent of Americans in 2022 said gender is determined by the sex at birth, up from 54 percent in 2017. Democrats‚Äô opposition to allowing trans girls and women to compete in women‚Äôs sports increased to 48 percent in 2023, from 41 percent in 2021, according to Gallup, while independent voters‚Äô opposition increased to 67 percent from 63 percent.

Rather than try to push Americans in a direction they clearly oppose, Democrats would be better off endorsing nuanced and humane alternatives. Some in the party are already seeing the value in such an approach.

‚ÄúDemocrats spend way too much time trying not to offend anyone rather than being brutally honest about the challenges many Americans face,‚Äù Seth Moulton, a Democratic representative from Massachusetts, told The Times last week. ‚ÄúI have two little girls; I don‚Äôt want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I‚Äôm supposed to be afraid to say that.‚Äù

Democrats have long been on the right side of health care, scientific progress, women‚Äôs rights, gay rights and education. This is the party that truly cares about families and aims to address their needs, especially on the more pressing economic issues that have many Americans feeling that their backs are up against a wall. But on transgender issues specifically, one way to make clear that Democrats are listening to their constituencies would be to accept a broader range of perspectives.

Trump has made already clear how extreme a position he will take, even potentially moving toward bans on gender medicine for adults. Transgender people are understandably fearful of what a second Trump administration might mean for their future.

The tenor of Trump‚Äôs vitriol could embolden real transphobes and inflame wider hate of and discrimination against transgender people as well as gay men and lesbians. The gay rights movement rightly fears a backslide. This is a scary time.

Democrats should fight these tendencies and ensure that everyone, regardless of gender identity or sexual orientation, is respected and protected under existing law. Rather than double down on beliefs and policies that are out of step with the best medical evidence, Democrats and everyone else who support transgender rights should embrace a common-sense approach from their government, their schools, their mental health care workers and their doctors. Vulnerable people are depending on it.",Thu Nov 14 12:59:00 +0000 2024,-0.07898346471107662,Oppose

Matt Gaetz, one of his most ardent supporters, to be attorney general in his new administration. Gaetz was under investigation by the House Ethics Committee until he resigned from Congress late Wednesday. 

‚ÄúMatt will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans‚Äô badly shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department,‚Äù the president-elect said in a statement. 

The former Florida congressman, who won his fifth term earlier this month, has frequently defended Trump and cast criminal cases against him as evidence of a weaponized justice system.

Gaetz called the May guilty verdict in Trump‚Äôs hush money trial ‚Äúthe corrupt result of a corrupt trial, a corrupt judge, and a corrupt DA. We will stand with President Trump now more than ever to save the country.‚Äù

In the House, Gaetz called for the ‚Äúmotion to vacate‚Äù vote last October that ousted Kevin McCarthy from the speakership. Gaetz said he opposed McCarthy‚Äôs decision to work with Democrats to avoid a government shutdown. McCarthy, however, said earlier this year that he lost his speakership ‚Äúbecause one person, a member of Congress, wanted me to stop an ethics complaint because he slept with a 17-year-old. ‚Ä¶ There's other people in jail because of it, and he wanted me to influence it.‚Äù

The House Ethics Committee was investigating Gaetz over allegations of, among other things, sexual misconduct, sharing inappropriate media on the House floor and using campaign funds for personal use. In June, the committee announced it was dropping some of those allegations, but that certain allegations, including those newly discovered, ‚Äúmerit continued review.‚Äù  

Last year, the Justice Department ‚Äì the agency he would oversee if he‚Äôs confirmed by the Senate ‚Äì said it would not bring charges against Gaetz, who had been under a federal sex-trafficking investigation since 2020. Gaetz told the New York Times that he had not a sexual relationship with a minor and called the other allegations of wrongdoing against him ‚Äúunequivocally false.‚Äù

Gaetz has a law degree from William & Mary Law School.",Thu Nov 14 01:52:07 +0000 2024,-0.09122421695951108,Oppose

The FBI recently raided the home of Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan, seizing his phone and electronics in what the company claims is ""political retribution"" following Polymarket‚Äôs accurate prediction of Trump‚Äôs victory.

Although Coplan was not arrested, this follows Polymarket's previous regulatory issues, including a $1.2 million settlement with the CFTC in 2022 for unregistered operations.

The DOJ is reportedly investigating Polymarket for allegedly allowing U.S. users to access its prediction market via VPN, despite it being technically off-limits. 

Coplan criticized the raid as a politically motivated attempt to suppress innovation.
