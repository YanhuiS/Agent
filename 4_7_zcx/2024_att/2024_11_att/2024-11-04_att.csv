This wasn't some random act. Philippi is an accelerationist – a white supremacist who believes burning everything to the ground is how they’ll build a white ethnostate. He wasn’t just talking, either. He went all-in: explosives, mapped-out targets, and even a ritual before his intended attack. 

Thinking he was untouchable, he spilled every detail to undercover agents, from evasion tactics to how he’d torch his own clothes to erase evidence. But federal authorities had eyes on him the whole time, and now he’s facing charges that could lock him up for life. 

Let this be a reminder: the FBI is vigilant, and these hate-driven plans will not stand. Don’t get distracted; they’re setting the stage for Coup 2.0, but it won’t work.",Mon Nov 04 23:32:41 +0000 2024,0.0015873015873015897,Support

Why he will win:

– He’s polling his best ever and he typically outperforms polls

– Supporting Trump has been destigmatized 
        -Anecdotal, but for the first time ever, people regularly express shock that I’m not a Trump supporter (and I live outside of most filter bubbles)
        -His nonsense has become normalized
        –He has much broader support from tech and corporate America than before. 

–Kamala is a terrible candidate who doesn’t stand for anything, is uninspiring, and feels to many like the embodiment of everything wrong with establishment politics. 

–Democrats have alienated too many voters with identity politics and many Jews for their stances on Israel  

–The enthusiasm for Kamala/the fear of Trump isn’t great enough. 

–As a founder of Augur and first investor in @Polymarket you better believe I believe in the markets 🤣

Why we might know the results as soon as tomorrow:

–If Kamala loses the east coast swing states PA, NC, and GA, the election is over, even if she wins every swing state to the west. 

–Vote counting operations are going to be a lot tighter/smoother given the chaos Trump created last time. 

–If Kamala loses PA it’s because she didn’t pick Josh Shapiro as VP and shame on her for that. 

–If Trump loses PA, I wouldn’t discredit it being due to alienating 500k Puerto Ricans there due to the MSG rally (I say that as someone who lives in PR.)

Why this all sadly may be a good thing:

–Most cynically, I’m terrified what happens if Kamala wins in just about any case, but certainly if the election is close or fairly contested. Jan 6 was just a teaser.

–The Dems don’t deserve this win, and need to regroup and realign to the center where they once represented the majority of Americans. 

–Trump won’t last four years, and JD Vance is the most intellectually impressive politician I’ve seen on the national stage since Obama, despite having some abhorrent social views. 

–Trump’s cast of centrist oddballs like Tulsi, Musk, RFK, Vivek-ish could actually do cool stuff if empowered. I’m tired of partisan politics. 

–The markets are going to react incredibly well to a Trump win (see my last tweet)

Conclusion
It’s a sad state of affairs and I’m glad I’m disqualified from voting in this election, but regardless of what happens, it really doesn’t feel like the end of the world. Kamala wouldn’t accomplish much and Trump has the potential to fulfill some cool promises, but also likely have his worst instincts be moderated by those he appears to be surrounding himself with. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯",Mon Nov 04 23:53:01 +0000 2024,0.1511809827599301,Support

The 2024 presidential election will be remembered for podcasts breaking through as a major source of news.

In an era where trust in mainstream media is at an all-time low, presidential candidates have opted for long-form interviews with popular independent voices.

Who could have seen this coming?!

DS: ""Podcasts could play a huge role. Just like in 2016 social media broke through and played a huge role. In 2024, I think that podcasts could break through.""

JC: ""Podcasts will decide the election.""

DS: ""And be the way unorthodox candidates get their message out.""

JC: ""It could be the way all candidates get their message out.""

@Jason on E143 (August 2023):

JC: ""We're moving from traditional media defining these candidates to direct-to-consumer, direct through Twitter/@X, direct through podcasts, this podcast included.""

JC: ""What we're witnessing right now is the transition from traditional media and the establishment defining who the great candidates are, to the public and the people on podcasts and social media, who are the tip of the spear and the vanguard.""

Harris has the support of 51% of likely voters to Trump’s 47% – a lead just outside the poll’s 3.5-point margin of error.

A little more than half of independents support the Republican nominee, a 5-point lead over Harris.

“It has been and remains a close election,” said Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public Opinion. “As far as the popular vote is concerned, it's hers to lose.”

The 2024 campaign has been shaped by dramatic events unlike any other election year in modern American history: the sitting president and presumptive Democratic nominee withdrawing from the race less than four months before Election Day; the first woman of color nominated as a major party candidate; two assassination attempts on the Republican nominee; and the same nominee convicted on 34 felony charges.

Among those who have already voted, Harris leads Trump 56% to 42%. But with voters who have yet to cast ballots, 53% plan to vote for Trump; while 45% support Harris, according to the poll.

Likely voters surveyed in this poll greatly resemble the 2020 electorate, which backed President Joe Biden with 51% of the popular vote to Trump’s 47%.

“We've gone through all of this to get back to … pretty much where you ended up four years ago,” Miringoff said. “We'll see if the Electoral College mirrors that.”

In the last week, JD Vance & Nikki Haley--both of whom were very enthusiastic to hit Iran hard a few months ago--have signaled what I think is a significant departure from what looked & sounded like agitation for war with Iran.

Vance is now saying war with Iran is not in the US's best interest. He says it would be a hugely expensive diversion of resources. And that our interests diverge with israel's on this point.

Haley is now saying we shouldn't bomb Iran, that we should impose sanctions & assassinate Iranian leadership instead. This follows the model israel has demonstrated in taking out the leadership of Hezbollah.

SUMMARY IF TRUMP WINS:
▪️De-escalation in the Russia-Ukraine war
▪️Sanctions against Iran & its proxies
▪️Assassinations of IRGC leadership & proxy leadership

ANALYSIS:
[Sanctions + Targeted Assassinations] could amount to a color revolution in Iran. Some Trump supporters say he's against regime change, based on his statements on the PBD podcast, but I think that interpretation is tenuous. 

I think this messaging from Vance & Haley is the compromise Trump is promoting to the warhawk wing of the GOP & his influential jewish/israeli financial backers who want to defang Iran. And it could include a color revolution, or perhaps something just short of that.

I think this is one of the (many) reasons Elon Musk supports Trump. You'll recall that Musk participated heavily in the attempted zionist-backed color revolution against Venezuela a few months ago. Peter Thiel, another influential Trump supporter, controls the Palantir technology that will be required to implement these plans.

I think this messaging, in combination with statements Trump has made to Musk on Twitter spaces, indicates Trump absolutely wants to stear clear of WW3. And I think that reticence is what motivated the assassination attempts: you don't kill a president to stop a war, you do it to start one.

A Kamala Harris presidency means the war in Russia-Ukraine will continue. It probably also means large-scale attacks on Iran, as we saw a few weeks ago in israel's aborted attack on Iran. It's full overthrow of Iran. It involves NATO, Russia & likely China. That's the WW3 scenario.

I think these differences between Trump's jewish backing and Kamala's jewish backing are why Iran hasn't retaliated, yet. They're waiting to see who & what they're going to get.",Mon Nov 04 21:25:00 +0000 2024,0.051742424242424236,Support

We used to be in California, but we moved to Texas. We're still in America. But if the Dems won this election, they will legalize enough illegals to turn the swing states, and everywhere will be like California. There will be no escape.

Historically, we’ve seen $BTC climb significantly after past elections. While that might not mean a direct correlation, Trump’s pro-crypto stance and his policy proposals could act as a strong catalyst if he comes out on top. His win would likely send a clear signal to institutions, potentially easing regulatory pressure and inviting more capital into the space, adding fuel to a post-election rally.

But what if Kamala wins? We’d likely see an initial dip in $BTC, with alts following as market sentiment reacts to this outcome. While this might shake the market in the short term, the long-term impact isn’t that dramatic (it might not exist at all IMO). Plenty of capital is currently sitting on the sidelines, held back by election uncertainty. Once the outcome is clear, that cash is likely to start flowing in, regardless of the victor, as investors seek more stability.

In either case, the election outcome will set the tone for crypto's regulatory landscape, but the broader momentum behind $BTC remains strong.",Mon Nov 04 12:05:01 +0000 2024,0.12858333333333333,Support

Kamala Harris or Donald Trump.
Whoever wins, there’s one thing that’s been increasingly playing on my mind.
The Americanisation of British politics.
The race between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is so polarised. Two people – and two groups of supporters – so certain they are right and the other side is wrong – disagreeing so fundamentally on pretty much everything.
And the tone of the debate too… the violence of the language… the two tribes on social media becoming ever more entrenched.
It feels like it’s happening here too. 
And it’s reflected in the media as well. America has long had opinionated news outlets… there’s no Ofcom requiring impartiality in TV media… and big brand media personalities espousing their own views.
You can see the trend towards that in the United Kingdom too… with more partisan outlets and media influencers. 
It’s not necessarily a bad thing… everyone has their bias, maybe it’s good if people are open about it. But it does change the tone of the debate. And it does mean that as a news consumer, if you prefer to have your own views amplified rather than challenged – that’s easier.

“I think you can’t overstate the significance of Elon Musk joining this… not only the richest person in the world but the man with the most to lose is involved in this… Elon Musk joked to me, and he has, I think, many times said he’s going to go to prison if Trump loses.

You know, I don’t know if he’s going to prison, but he’ll, he’ll be destroyed, for sure, and he’s doing it anyway. So that gives a lot of different people heart, people who are vested in the system.”

Instead, I am left with a sense of unease. 

In 2016, I felt the energy that Trump brought to the campaign and was confident he would win. At that time, I was teaching in the Caribbean. The university organized a debate ahead of each election, but this time they could not find anyone willing to advocate for Trump. So that task ultimately fell to me. It was actually quite a lot of fun. Feels like such an innocent time looking back at it now. 

I was so certain of Trump's victory that instead of watching the election results come in on election night, I watched a Breaking Bad marathon. By around 1 a.m., it became clear that Trump had won.

At the time, I was completely unaware of the sinister forces coalescing to undermine him. I had no idea that the FBI had spent months pursuing Trump on fake charges, nor would I have believed it if someone had told me. I had no idea that Obama would hamstring Trump with the fraudulent Intelligence Community Assessment, nor that they would throw everything at him for the next four years.

By 2020, I had grown more cynical, yet in hindsight, I was probably still quite naive. I had a negative feeling about that election, both instinctively and objectively, primarily because Trump pretty much outsourced things to a complete fraud, Fauci, who undermined him at every turn.

Consequently, I was less engaged than I had been in 2016. I anticipated intelligence community interference, such as the fraudulent Hunter Biden letter. However, what I was still naive about was the extent of the election shenanigans regarding counting being stopped, ballot harvesting, late-night ballot drops, and so forth. I thought I had become quite hardened by four years of anti-Trump hoaxes, but the entire election situation was truly eye-opening.

Now, four years later, I look back and feel quite disillusioned. Objectively, Trump should win. The early numbers look promising, the polls are favorable, and other indicators, such as dissatisfaction with the current administration, also favor him. Yet, on a visceral level, I can't get myself to feel the same enthusiasm I felt in 2016. The innocence is gone.

Given everything that has transpired—from the fraudulent Russia collusion narrative to the numerous fabricated cases against Trump—surely, they are not going to allow him to simply walk back into the White House? I wish I didn't feel this way, but looking back at the past eight years, how can one not feel this way?",Mon Nov 04 22:00:23 +0000 2024,0.02920466058763933,Support

The US election is always bullish for #Bitcoin!

The 2024 United States presidential election has raised debates about how both candidates might shape the future of cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin.

There will be positive outcomes"" no matter which party wins the US election on Nov. 5, but if Donald Trump is gonna win, that will lead to “stronger gains” due to clearer pro-industry commitments.

Regardless of the outcome, one thing remains clear: 2025 can be the year of more comprehensive and favorable crypto regulations. 

The trend toward transparent and pro-crypto regulatory frameworks cannot be denied — this will be a critical factor for Bitcoin’s future.

“Elections in the United States, the most democratic country in the world.

In scene the largest conservative leader in modern time: Donald Trump.

How was the world under his administration? The United States projected power. We did not have new wars. There was peace throughout the world.

Today we see wars, terrorism making a comeback, and censorship restraining us all.

The return of Trump is the certainty for a better world. No wars, no terrorism, and a return to liberty in its purest form. 

Speaking on behalf of all Brazilians who love God, the state of Israel, respect the traditional family, private property, free markets, and free speech — our sincere best wishes.

Jair Bolsonaro, former president [of the Federal Republic of Brazil], ineligible to hold office without committing a single crime.

Like many, I was disappointed by Trump 45. He talked a big game but didn't deliver on much of it (although was way better than most presidents even still).

I believe these last 4 years 'in the wilderness' have been a gift from God. Being relentlessly attacked by the swamp, up to and including assassination attempts, has revealed to Trump exactly what he has to do and I genuinely believe Trump 47 will be very different, and way better, than Trump 45 was...

... And even if I'm wrong about that, at the very least the people AROUND Trump 47 are way better than those who were around 45, that's obvious, and so even if Trump himself reverts back to his previous behaviour I'm excited to see what these others will do in their respective portfolios.

Most Trump supporters know that Trump is a bullshitter and they don’t care. 

In fact, Trump’s propensity for bullshit is not a political liability, it’s a superpower.

Donald Trump is not unprecedented. He is not an alien force. He is a mirror. He reflects an America that runs on bullshit, that has become inured to bullshit, that has come to expect bullshit from its leaders. So when our elites insist that this is not the case, they come off as liars. And they also fail to grasp that sometimes even a bullshitter tells the truth.

@EliLake @bariweiss brilliant indeed.
