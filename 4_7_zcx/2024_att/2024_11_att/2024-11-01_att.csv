The energy is different this election season.

2016 - I didn’t think Trump was going to win.  Hillary was supposed to be Obamas third term.

2020 - I thought Trump was going to win but it was going to be tight.  I also believe COVID played a huge role.  There’s nothing like COVID playing a role this time AND we had social media suppressing very important information that could’ve influenced more than the margin of error that allowed Biden to “win”.  Hunter Biden laptop story.

2024 - We have Elon.  We have more crossovers than the left. We are more active and dominate in the information domain.  Kamala is the worst candidate in the history of politics.  Biden was at least “somewhat likable” to his side. 

I don’t believe the American people are ready to turn their country over to the establishment communist uniparty.

I believe Trump will receive well over 300 electoral votes and god willing we have him announced President Elect Tuesday late night, early AM Wednesday.

I will hold my nose and vote for Donald Trump next week if and only if the following condition is met: 

Sometime between now and Election Day, Trump mobilizes his supporters to help defeat Amendment 4. Unprompted (meaning a Truth Social post, rally comment, campaign mailing, etc. will qualify, but simply reiterating that he personally is voting no in reply to an interview question will not).

This is a staggeringly low bar to clear—far lower than I’ve ever had to even consider whether a Republican nominee could clear. It requires no effort or risk on Trump’s part, and commits him to no positions he doesn’t claim to already hold. It simply requires him to tell people who hang on his every word to vote the right way on something important while they’re already there to vote for him.

It wouldn't change my opinion that he’ll be a terrible joke of a president whose victory will do more harm than good, but it would show that there remains at least some lingering capacity to at least fake some basic regard for one of the core causes of the political party he assumed the responsibility of leading.

But if he can’t even do that—if he goes this entire campaign cycle without lifting a finger to help beat back the Left in a vitally important referendum—it will prove my point that conservatives can no longer count on him to do anything for us unless it just happens to be something he wants to do anyway.

Admittedly, part of why I'm willing to commit to this is that I expect Trump to lose Wisconsin regardless of how I vote, and that I'm certain Trump won't exceed my expectations for him. But again, the fact that a Republican standard-bearer being even mildly pro-life on his own is so unlikely is the point.

In two weeks, Mike Tyson will return to the ring, and I greatly appreciate his endorsement of President Trump. Both Tyson and Trump are on the comeback trail and they are going to WIN! Tyson often remarks how when he was in trouble, Donald Trump always stood by him and maintained his friendship. In the past, the heavyweight champion playfully threw punches at Donald Trump. I enjoyed the same opportunity to throw punches at Mike Tyson in my Sheriff’s Office. We are all winners because we keep fighting back and never surrender!

I first met Tyson in Phoenix, and also later when he was incarcerated in my Tent City jail. While in jail, I asked Tyson to speak to the youth about the ravages of alcohol, drugs, and crime. He agreed, and I am sure in the process he saved many lives.

I noticed Tyson has a “tough guy” image, yet he is a very humble person. He took his punishment like a man, turned himself and others around, and is helping the USA with his endorsement of President Trump. I had over 2.3 million inmates over my 24 years as Maricopa County, Arizona Sheriff, which included athletes, celebrities, and others of diverse backgrounds who did time in my jail system. Mike Tyson is one of the most inspiring and uplifting comeback stories! Many of his fans consider him as their hero! In my case, it took me 86 years to find my one and only hero in my lifetime, and that is President Donald J. Trump!",Fri Nov 01 21:40:59 +0000 2024,0.1976719576719576,Support

Sources reveal the White House edited the official transcript of Biden’s comments on Trump supporters, changing ""supporters"" to ""supporter's"" to imply Biden was only referring to comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s remarks at a Trump rally.

This edit, unapproved by the stenographers, triggered a strong objection from their office, citing a “breach of protocol.”

The Trump campaign seized on Biden's comments, fueling backlash, and House Republicans, led by Elise Stefanik and James Comer, have signaled a possible investigation, alleging a potential breach of the Presidential Records Act.

But now Trump's comment about Cheney facing 9 guns, ""context doesn't matter. He said it."" Context does matter as in this case he is clearly talking about Liz carrying a rifle and facing 9 guns pointed back at her. Firing squads don't give the prisoner a gun to shoot back. So contextually, it can't be a firing squad. And as he was talking about war, context says that, especially since Liz has a gun in his statement, she is at war and not being executed.

And Liz, to prove his entire point, cries about Trump threatening her life. Yes, Liz. People die in war. Thank you for agreeing to his point.

The Associated Press on Thursday night issued a damning report about the White House's potentially illegal cover-up of President Biden's remark that Trump supporters are ""garbage.""

“The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters — his — his demonization of Latinos is unconscionable, and it’s un-American,” Biden said, according to the initial version of the official transcript.

But the White House made changes to the transcript in reaction to public fallout damaging the Harris campaign, according to the report.

As noted in the report, the White House added an apostrophe to “supporter’s” rather than “supporters,” so as to mislead Americans about Biden's remark.

""White House press officials altered the official transcript of a call in which President Joe Biden appeared to take a swipe at supporters of Donald Trump, drawing objections from the federal workers who document such remarks for posterity,"" the AP reported based on government sources.

The AP noted that the ""change was made after the press office 'conferred with the president,' according to an internal email from the head of the stenographers’ office.""

The supervisor noted that the issuance of the deceptive transcript was “a breach of protocol and spoliation of transcript integrity between the Stenography and Press Offices.”

President Joe Biden appears to be in violation of the Presidential Records Act of 1978. The @GOPoversight has issued notice to the White House to preserve records related to its ostensibly illegal conduct.

Donald Trump has adopted Biden's ""garbage"" smear as a rallying cry for the 2024 election. He even donned an orange vest and made a press statement from a MAGA garbage truck, leading to viral photos and videos, as well as a surge in Trump voter enthusiasm.",Fri Nov 01 10:47:41 +0000 2024,0.07142857142857142,Support

Kamala delivered her DC rally speech and cast herself as America’s protector against what she described as Trump’s divisive agenda, calling him a “petty tyrant” and pledging unity.

“Donald Trump has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid. 

That’s not who we are.”

As she contrasted her vision with Trump’s, Kamala vowed to fight for affordable healthcare, reproductive rights, and economic fairness. 

“If you give me the chance to fight on your behalf, there is nothing in the world that will stand in my way.”
