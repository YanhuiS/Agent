We've been hearing for years now how Donald Trump and his supporters are violent, white supremacist ""dangers to democracy."" Yet it was the former and future president who took a bullet to the ear in a barely failed assassination attempt in July, followed by a second shooter camped out on his golf course waiting to kill him in September.

Now, as the president-elect puts forth names for his Cabinet, those people and their families are being targeted with death threats. Disgusting.

The Trump-Vance Transition Team described what's been happening in a Wednesday morning email:

The email described how some of the nominees have been threatened with ""swatting,"" which the FBI defines as ""calling 9-1-1 and faking an emergency that draws a response from law enforcement‚Äîusually a SWAT team"" to a target's house. If law enforcement has been told that the ""suspect"" is armed and dangerous, they come with guns drawn.

Last night and this morning, several of President Trump's Cabinet nominees and Administration appointees were targeted in violent, unAmerican threats to their lives and those who live with them. These attacks ranged from bomb threats to 'swatting.' In response, law enforcement and other authorities acted quickly to ensure the safety of those who were targeted. President Trump and the entire Transition team are grateful for their swift action. 

Although the Trump team didn't go into details, law enforcement reaction was reportedly ""swift"":

Nearly a dozen of President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs Cabinet nominees and other appointees tapped for the incoming administration were targeted Tuesday night with ""violent, unAmerican threats to their lives and those who live with them,"" prompting a ""swift"" law enforcement response, Fox News Digital has learned.

The ""attacks ranged from bomb threats to ‚Äòswatting,‚Äô"" according to Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman and incoming White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

Leavitt said the threats would not slow the transition team down: ""With President Trump as our example, dangerous acts of intimidation and violence will not deter us.‚Äù

Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) was one of those targeted:

‚ÄúThis morning, Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, her husband, and their three year old son were driving home to Saratoga County from Washington for Thanksgiving when they were informed of a bomb threat to their residence. New York State, County law enforcement, and U.S. Capitol Police responded immediately with the highest levels of professionalism. We are incredibly appreciative of the extraordinary dedication of law enforcement officers who keep our communities safe 24/7. We want to share our best wishes to the Upstate NY community for a happy and safe Thanksgiving. We are especially grateful to our law enforcement officers and military families who are on duty over the holiday season.‚Äù

MSNBC‚Äôs Joy Reid took all the joy out of Thanksgiving by going on a 10 minute meltdown rant about how Trump supporters won‚Äôt get a ‚Äúcookie, trophy or hug‚Äù from her.

Oh no, how awful.

Still furious that Trump supporters refer to ‚Äòundocumented immigrants‚Äô as ‚Äúillegal immigrants‚Äù (they are), Reid suggested ‚Äúright-wingers‚Äù should have to suffer the consequences of voting for Trump.

‚ÄúMake your own sandwiches, wipe your own tears, troll amongst yourselves with Elon, and leave us alone,‚Äù said the host, acting as if Trump supporters would want to socialize with her anyway.

‚ÄúYou got your heart‚Äôs desire. The president you dreamed of and worshiped instead of Jesus. And this time, you didn‚Äôt even have to storm the Capitol, smash the windows or try to kill police officers or issue death threats to poll workers,‚Äù she added.

‚ÄúBut if you expect the 73 million who voted for the prosecutor, not the felon, and particularly the 92% of black women who voted for Kamala to give you a cookie for your vote, a trophy, a hug, a high five, you might be asking too much,‚Äù said Reid.

No one asked, Joy, no one asked.

‚ÄúIf we want to eat with you, we will. But if we just want some peace over the holidays, and we don‚Äôt want to put up with your trolling‚Ä¶ get over it. Stop acting like we owe you,‚Äù added the host, pretending as though any Trump voter actually thinks like this.

‚ÄúAnd for God‚Äôs sake, stop whining, it‚Äôs embarrassing, our Thanksgiving, our choice,‚Äù she concluded.

The only person whining is you, Joy, for 10 minutes straight.

Given that MSNBC is up for sale and Elon Musk has suggested he might buy it, this might be the last Thanksgiving that Reid will have to spew such vitriol on cable news.

This year, I am most thankful that God, and many hard working people, delivered a LANDSLIDE reelection for President Trump. 

His win is the biggest win for America, and the world, in a long time. The landslide sets the foundation for NATIONAL UNITY which is something we all deserve. 

This time I have high hopes that even the media will be kind to President Trump. He's on his way to becoming the GREATEST PRESIDENT of our lifetime. 

Hope everyone has a great day and that all Americans are inspired by his victory and push themselves to do similarly great things to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.

I am doing my part by running for Congress in District NY21. Enjoy your time with friends and family and don't eat too much.

Wow, okay‚Äîthis is, like, a whole drama unfolding. So, let‚Äôs unpack it. Trump‚Äôs always been about, like, surprising picks, right? But these? Yikes. Even his fans are like, ""Um, excuse me, what are you doing?""

First up‚ÄîDr. Bhattacharya. The guy‚Äôs been a lightning rod ever since COVID, with all those takes that basically flipped the script on mainstream pandemic strategies. So, yeah, sticking him in charge of the NIH? It‚Äôs like handing the keys of a Prius to someone who swears by monster trucks. Kinda feels like Trump wanted to make a point rather than pick someone everyone could get behind.

Then there‚Äôs John Phelan‚ÄîSecretary of the Navy. A businessman. For the Navy. Like, okay, I get the whole ‚Äúrun the government like a business‚Äù vibe Trump‚Äôs into. But even his own base is side-eying this one. The military crowd especially‚Äîthey don‚Äôt mess around when it comes to qualifications. They want someone who‚Äôs, you know, actually seen a battleship in real life.

The backlash on Truth Social is the cherry on top. Veterans calling it out, people bringing God into it (classic move, btw). The favoritism angle isn‚Äôt new‚Äîcritics always say Trump rewards loyalty‚Äîbut it‚Äôs clearly rubbing folks the wrong way this time.  

And honestly, this might be a bigger deal than he expected. Like, how do you win back the crowd when your biggest cheerleaders are now holding up ‚ÄúWhat the heck, man?‚Äù signs?

‚ÄúI would like this date (1,000 days of Russia's full-scale invasion - ed.) to also allow our main allies, our main partners to rethink and move away from the policy of reactivity and delay to quick decisive steps, that is, to achieve peace through force,‚Äù he said.

The Minister noted that this approach is also supported by President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky.

‚ÄúThis approach has also been voiced by President Zelensky and we assume that it will be the basis for the activities of the new US administration of President-elect Trump. It is the achievement of peace through strength, the achievement of a comprehensive just peace. And this concept has clear elements,‚Äù he added.

Sybiha highlighted the key elements of ‚Äúpeace through strength‚Äù:

No compromises with the territorial integrity and sovereignty of Ukraine

Nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine

‚ÄúAnd these elements also require very clear and understandable steps: inviting Ukraine to NATO, lifting any restrictions on the supply of weapons to Ukraine, as well as Ukraine's use of weapons on the territory of Russia, on the territory of Russia, but of course, for military purposes,‚Äù he added.

1- The US runs a trade and current account deficit with most major economies of the world. These economies provide Goods and we provide some Services. This is well understood by markets and policy makers

2- On the other side of the current account deficit, the US exports safe and risky assets to the rest of the world. This concept is not well understood but supported by the increasing role of US assets in global portfolios, the accelerated negative trend in NIIP, among others

3. US equities trade at high valuations after a hot run since Oct 2023, led by multiple expansion and also solid EPS growth. Forward estimates price - correctly in my view - further EPS growth and disinflation

4. Trump 2.0 Trade War will pressure the multiple, and given starting point of the multiple and EPS growth expectations, the path of least resistance will be multiple compression and negative EPS revisions

5. FCI composition will change, with equities tightening FCI but US rates loosening to offset the negative wealth effect. A one price shock on PCE will not be an issue as the likely response from the corporate sector is a negative sentiment shock, lowering Capex and labor demand prospects

6. What is now a balanced labor market, will turn into a soft labor market pretty quickly. This is why I been so critical of rates traders overweighting spot/past data, because the bar to disrupt the current balance of the labor market is low.. one nasty Trade war will do

Marc Elias' FEC win allowed campaigns to coordinate with PACs, reshaping election strategies.

2) The campaign adopted the ""Florida model,"" combining grassroots efforts with advanced data targeting.

3) Elon Musk joined late, funding canvassing in battlegrounds like PA. By Election Day, his team spent $200M and reached deep into rural communities.

4) Trump‚Äôs coalition: rural, working-class voters & first-timers. Data sharing between GOP groups maximized efficiency, targeting these ""forgotten"" voters.

5) Trump swept every swing state, won the popular vote for the first time since 2004, & became the 2nd president to win non-consecutive terms.

6) The challenge ahead: converting Trump-only voters into consistent GOP supporters. The 2024 win relied on unprecedented coordination & voter outreach. Can it be replicated?

The two most important jobs at the Department of Defense are undersecretary for policy and undersecretary for intelligence. 

Do you want @MorganOrtagus to make military policy? She is a Never Trumper. Voted for Biden. Supported DeSantis and worked for Pompeo. 

@ElbridgeColby for intelligence? 
Business partner of Anthony Blinken and George Soros. Pompeo loyalist.

The caravan disbandment is reportedly in response to diplomatic pressures linked to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump‚Äôs recent immigration policy statements. 

The migrants, primarily from Latin American countries, aimed to travel through Mexico en route to the U.S. border. Officials cited security concerns and the lack of legal travel documents as primary reasons for intervention. This action underscores a shift in migration policies amid growing international tensions over immigration.

While migrants are not being repatriated, many are demanding humanitarian visas to continue their journey north. As long as they remain in Mexico, their ultimate goal is entry into the United States. The Trump-Sheinbaum agreement shows promise but has yet to address the complexity of the issue fully.

Setting aside all the social media hype and high five's, the situation on the ground in Mexico is far more nuanced. With an estimated 1 million migrants spread throughout the country, organized crime preys on this vulnerable population, often smuggling them across more remote border regions.

To achieve sustainable success, the three migrant pillars must be addressed:

1. Migrants will not voluntarily go back to their country of origin.
2. They will not remain permanently in Mexico.
3. Today's rejected asylum seekers are tomorrow's gotaways.

What comes next for Mexico is ""Operacion Hormiga"" or ant operation, a strategy characterized by gradual, small-scale, and discreet actions that accumulate to achieve a larger goal. 

In migration, ""operaci√≥n hormiga‚Äù refers to the practice of migrants crossing borders in small, scattered groups to evade detection by authorities. This tactic is often employed to avoid large-scale apprehensions associated with migrant caravans or organized mass crossings.

This practice is more commonly used in narcotics smuggling. Organized crime use ‚Äúoperaci√≥n hormiga‚Äù to move small quantities of goods (e.g., drugs, contraband, or migrants) over time, reducing the risk of detection by law enforcement compared to moving larger shipments.",Thu Nov 28 04:52:17 +0000 2024,0.08011904761904763,Support

This leads me to believe that Trump is also in contact with Putin, likely trying to diffuse tensions.

Trump promised he would prevent WW3 and have the war in Ukraine stopped within 24 hours. The only way he could do that, is by negotiating before he steps in office. He has already spoken to Netanyahu, Orb√°n, Milei, Rutte, Zelensky, Trudeau, Macron, Duda, Sheinbaum, etc., why not Putin?

Surely, the joke is on us
Peta Credlin The Australian November 28, 2024
********Crucial reading.

Describing climate change as a hoax, as Donald Trump does, may be going too far, but much of the policy to deal with it is certainly a scam and the sooner that‚Äôs recognised the better. 

The Albanese government is party to a giant global heist, a monumental rip-off of some countries by others, which Labor is trying to bury until after the election, hoping the public won‚Äôt notice until it‚Äôs too late.

It‚Äôs bad enough the federal government has consistently failed to be upfront about the cost of meeting its emissions reduction targets;
 far from helping to cut power bills by $275 per household a year, it has instead increased them by up to $1000. 
It also has no credible plan to firm the electricity supply when and if renewables become 82 per cent of total power in just six years (as the government demands they should).

And it‚Äôs now trying to renege on an earlier promise to announce its even more ambitious (or ruinous) 2035 targets before the election next year.
 
But as bad as all that is, it‚Äôs now trying to keep us in the dark about the ramifications of a series of new international commitments that will inevitably have massive implications for domestic policy and the federal budget, which is already bleeding red ink in the forward estimates.

With an election looming, Labor is desperate to keep secret its submission to the International Court of Justice in support of rich countries‚Äô supposed legal obligations to meet climate targets;  as well as the implications for Australia of its agreement to participate in a nearly half-trillion dollar a year climate fund to pay reparations to the supposed victims of climate injustice.

Last year, at the urging of Pacific Island countries that claim they are threatened with climate-driven inundation, the UN General Assembly requested the ICJ to provide an advisory opinion on countries‚Äô obligations under international law to protect the climate ‚Äúfor present and future generations‚Äù.

The aim is to seek clarity on the legal consequences for countries such as Australia whose actions (or inactions) have supposedly ‚Äúcaused significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment‚Äù.

Australia co-sponsored this resolution. 

This is despite credible research findings that more islands in the Pacific and Indian oceans are growing than shrinking, regardless of the impact (if any) of climate change.

As reported by the ABC in 2021, using satellite images of islands as well as on-the-ground analysis, scientists at the University of Auckland have concluded ‚Äúthe majority of islands ‚Ä¶ has either got larger or stayed very similar in size‚Äù. 
While at pains to stress that this did not mean there was nothing to worry about (naturally enough, so as not to risk future research grants), the scientists concluded that coral reefs, regardless of any sea level rise, were producing enough sediment for most islands to grow.

But doubtless driven by the Albanese government‚Äôs need for Pacific Islands support to hold the 2026 COP climate conference, the government earlier this year made a (thus far) secret written submission to the ICJ reinforcing, according to our embassy in the Netherlands, Australia‚Äôs view that ‚Äúclimate change is the single greatest threat to the livelihoods, security and wellbeing of the peoples of the Pacific‚Äù and declaring that Australia ‚Äúrecognises the importance of taking urgent action‚Äù. 
And on December 3, so next week, Australia will make its oral submission to the court at The Hague.

While rulings of the ICJ are not binding, they are impactful and can‚Äôt be appealed. 
For instance, it was an ICJ ruling on the return of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, including the vital Diego Garcia military base, that the British Labour government cited when it recently surrendered its sovereignty.

Vanuatu, the country that‚Äôs leading this case at the international court, says Trump‚Äôs re-election, and the likely withdrawal of the US from the Paris climate accord, makes the court‚Äôs clarification of wealthy countries‚Äô legal obligations even more important, which is why it‚Äôs so wrong that the Albanese government has never published its submission.

At the UN climate conference in Azerbaijan last week, Climate Change and Energy Minister Chris Bowen co-chaired the session on climate finance, namely the reparations that rich countries are supposed to pay to developing countries, including China.

At this conference China demanded the West pay $1.8 trillion every single year into this fund, which shows some hide given that China‚Äôs emissions in just the past decade have exceeded Britain‚Äôs total emissions since the start of the industrial revolution.

While the China ambit claim was not agreed to, the Bowen-chaired session did agree that wealthy countries would be on the hook to pay more than $450bn every year into this climate fund from 2035 ‚Äì a fund China won‚Äôt pay into but will likely draw down from as a supposedly developing country, even though China is the world‚Äôs second largest economy and the world‚Äôs biggest emitter.

Unsurprisingly, in this climate theatre of ever more extravagant promises and even more extreme demands, $450bn a year has been denounced as totally inadequate. 

India‚Äôs COP representative slammed it as a ‚Äúpaltry sum‚Äù that was ‚Äúnothing more than an optical illusion‚Äù.
Yet the fact India has committed to achieve net-zero emissions only by 2070 strongly suggests the world‚Äôs fifth biggest economy, and third biggest emitter, regards climate as more a means of moral blackmail, to extort ever more development aid, than as an existential threat.

While Australia produces just over 1 per cent of the world‚Äôs emissions, our coal and gas exports mean we could be held partly responsible for much more because of efforts to count the fossil fuels we send overseas, and that other countries use, as part of our aggregate total emissions. 
This means that our resources that power the Chinese economy could end up counting towards Australia‚Äôs climate reparations. 
That‚Äôs the madness in all of this! 
As well, Australia has about 4 per cent of the total GDP of G20 developed countries. 
In other words, we could be liable to pay as much as $20bn a year into this $450bn annual fund, yet still the Prime Minister is refusing to quantify our eventual financial obligations.

Despite signing us up to a presumably gargantuan future commitment, all Bowen had to say in the wake of the Baku climate gabfest was that Australia would become ‚Äúthe sixth largest contributor to the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage with a $50m contribution‚Äù.

This, he said, ‚Äúbuilds on our foundational $100m contribution to the Pacific Resilience Facility, a Pacific-owned facility that will support locally led, small-scale projects across the Blue Pacific Continent that respond to loss and damage‚Äù.

As well, the government recently announced a $300m contribution to the Asian Development Bank ‚Äúto support climate action in Asia and the Pacific‚Äù.

When pensioners can barely pay their power bills, Australians are being forced to go back to the days I remember as a child, growing up in the blistering heat of Victoria‚Äôs Mallee ‚Äì of blackouts, darkened homes in summer absent modern airconditioning and generators keeping fridges going.

All the while, we‚Äôre sinking further and further into debt while shovelling billions overseas to atone for our good fortune of living on a continent rich in fossil fuels that we can export but can‚Äôt use.
 
Honestly, the joke‚Äôs on us, isn‚Äôt it?

In March 2022, during an appearance on Fox News, Kellogg called on Americans with the appeal: ""Let's find a way to allow this new Sparta, Ukraine, to win the battle. And they can. We just have to give them the support they need.""

However, today, General Kellogg is the author of what may be the only publicly proposed plan for peace negotiations with Russia. In April 2024, in collaboration with former CIA analyst Fred Fleitz, he published an article in Foreign Affairs titled ""America First, Russia, & Ukraine,"" outlining his vision for a peace negotiation plan with Russia. The key points of the plan can be summarized as follows:

The United States should continue to arm Ukraine and strengthen its defenses to ensure that Russia cannot launch new attacks following a ceasefire or the signing of a peace agreement.

In return for assistance, the United States should require Ukraine to participate in peace negotiations with Russia. These negotiations would need to be conducted from a position of strength, with clear consequences outlined for Russia in the event of any violations of the peace terms.

To persuade Putin to join the talks, NATO leaders should propose postponing Ukraine‚Äôs accession to the Alliance for an extended period. This would form part of a comprehensive and enforceable peace agreement that guarantees Ukraine‚Äôs security.

The plan specifies that Ukraine would not be required to renounce its objective of reclaiming all of its territory. However, it would need to agree to pursue this goal exclusively through diplomatic, not military, means. The authors emphasize that a diplomatic breakthrough would only be feasible after Putin leaves office. Until then, the United States and its allies would maintain sanctions against Russia and normalize relations only after Russia signs a peace agreement acceptable to Ukraine.

P.S. The proposed plan is not official and will likely be subject to revisions, but it already raises significant concerns. The concessions to Russia on which it is based merely encourage further aggression and increase the risk of new violations. In my opinion, security guarantees for Ukraine after the failure of the Budapest Memorandum appear illusory, and disregarding the sentiments of Ukrainian society renders this approach unrealistic and overly idealistic.
