GERARDO GOMEZ-RUANO, MARIO LOPEZ-VITAL, AND YURI SERBOLOV
Abstract. We provide an unbiased estimate for the presidential election that recently took place in Mexico, based on data from the first election recount done by its citizens. The recount was done as the answer to the unapologetically fraudulent electoral process that culminated with the June 2nd 2024 elections. Such recount is partial since only 10% of the ballot boxes have been reliably accounted for, approximately; it may thus be considered a sample for the entire election. Because ballot boxes can be tracked over different elections, we are able to construct a bias-corrected estimate of the true, national tally. One that is free from the effects from crime coercion and government manipulation, and therefore far more reliable than the official “count”. Our correction implies that Mrs. Xóchitl Gálvez won obtaining 50.74% of the votes, while Mrs. Claudia Sheinbaum lost obtaining only 38.82% of the votes.

President Trump made history in the 2024 Presidential election with a landslide victory, breaking the blue wall and proving MAGA is the future. 

Americans rejected the chaos of the Biden-Harris regime and delivered a mandate for real change.

Podcast host Joe Rogan explains why he has grown to like President-elect Donald Trump. Rogan endorsed Trump in the 2024 presidential election.

JOE ROGAN: The quote about Trump or the narrative about Trump has always been that he's bullsh*tting everybody. He's a con man He's definitely very persuasive, you know, Scott Adams has wrote about this pretty much in depth about how well Trump Practices the art of persuasion. Mm-hmm, you know the art of the deal He's great at making people his friend and making relationships and if you're his enemy, f*ck you scorched earth You know, it's like this and there's fear of that.

You don't want to get on his bad side There's all this like there's this art of like how he negotiates and he's gone through this years and years and years of business But but that's him. That's the guy's right there. You could talk to him about everything and anything.

He's right there He's not protecting any of his ideas. He called a girl. He's allegedly slept with horse face on Twitter It's the wildest sh*t.

So you're getting what you get. That's who the guy is and you love I like him I've gone I've grown to like him. I had a much more negative opinion of him back in the day because it was There's only so much you can pay attention to and do deep dives on right before you lose your f*cking mind and with him I was like It's probably not good for the country.

That seems crazy. But as time went on I was like, oh you need a guy that is completely crazy to expose how corrupt the whole system is and how they all Collude together and how they all they all say this There's all these montages of clips of news organizations saying the same narrative outright over and over Verbatim word by word they're getting fed this by someone some entity some they're somehow or another they're collaborating and they're all Choosing this very specific narrative and they're running with it and they're trying to destroy people with it and I saw them do it with Yeah, I saw them do it with me during the Koba thing and it was all motivated by the pharmaceutical drug companies and the profits And they were terrified that someone's gonna come along and somehow another put a notch in this little thing that they've created Which is a devious little thing that they've done where they eliminated all sorts of other remedies They they cut out all these Generic drugs that possibly could have been used to help people. They denied people the use of monoclonal antibodies They push the f*cking sh*t out of this one thing so they can make money off of it and they did it in collusion with The media no one acted like a journalist.

No one looked at the excess deaths No one looked at the instances of myocarditis and young people. No one looked at any of that. There was no journalism.

It just showed Everyone that the whole system is bought and paid for it's all corrupt And the only way you could find out who a person really is is to listen to them Talk for long periods of time.

For many Republicans in general—and MAGA and Trump supporters in particular—it’s unforgivable that Speaker Mike Johnson caved to pressure from Democrats and RINO Republicans to pass a continuing resolution and fund the government. This decision was a disgrace and a major disappointment because it funds initiatives Trump’s administration wants to discontinue, undermining key priorities.

Speaker Johnson has been the main actor behind this betrayal. While he’s a Republican, many see him as a RINO—Republican in name only—because he abandoned core conservative principles. Many are baffled as to why Donald Trump remains cordial toward him. 

Additionally, Johnson gave up the voter ID bill, known as the SAVE Act, which would have mandated binding voter ID requirements for all federal elections. Republicans had sought to tie this critical legislation to the funding bill, but Speaker Johnson backed down and agreed to separate the SAVE Act from the continuing resolution, prioritizing avoiding a government shutdown over protecting election integrity.

Many MAGA proponents and Trump supporters were willing to see a government shutdown to force Congress to accept the SAVE Act. By choosing to cave and fund the government through the end of the year, Johnson made a catastrophic mistake. 

For this reason, many conservatives refuse to forgive Speaker Johnson—and likely never will. Rumors are already swirling about plans to replace him with a new Republican Speaker in the next Congress.",Sun Nov 17 12:56:58 +0000 2024,0.15052498670919726,Support

Well Canada,I royally fkd up. I underestimated the American People and thought for sure my glorious twin Kamala was going to Win and help me tank what’s left of the West. Years of gaslighting Trump and calling him names has now come to bite me in the 🫏. He is  now President. Years of unvetted,unverified Immigration into Canada,I’ve allowed the worst of the worst putting the lives of every Canadian and American in danger. Currently Canada is full of Terrorists. My open support of them has also bit me in the 🫏. The American Government has recently deemed Canada a threat to National Security. You can only imagine,I’m completely 💩ing my pants right now. You don’t want to know what Trump and his administration said to me. Because of that I have to back peddle hard because Trump is coming to Canada in 2025 and the potential of him kicking my 🫏 is real. I’m literally scared of my own shadow. 
Also,there is chatter of Canadians networking for a protest a thousand times the size of the Freedom Convoy. That scares me even more than my shadow. Happy Babies,Patriotic Canadians singing,dancing,hugging,laughing and sharing a love of their Country. ( Shudder)
I can’t have that. I won’t have that. I’m going to do my best to Lie,Cheat and Steal from you all as much as I can before I am voted out or physically removed by the People.
