Former President Donald Trump is expected to introduce a policy that could see the dismissal of all transgender individuals currently serving in the U.S. military. This policy, potentially enacted through an executive order on his first day back in office, would affect approximately 15,000 service members, leading to their discharge.

Additionally, this move would also block transgender individuals from enlisting in the future, shifting back to policies from before the Obama administration's changes. Critics argue that such a policy could exacerbate existing recruitment challenges within the military, potentially affecting readiness and unit cohesion.

Trump's proposed Defense Secretary, Pete Hegseth, supports this initiative, viewing it as a strategic step to ""clean up"" what he perceives as inefficiencies and distractions within the military structure.",Sun Nov 24 23:53:25 +0000 2024,0.008645276292335118,Support

These are the same goofballs who made excuses for Bill Barr, Nikki Haley, Mark Milley, James Mattis, Christopher Wray, John Bolton, Mike Pompeo, and Stephanie Grisham. 

Aside from RFK and Tulsi, these 2nd Admin picks are horrendous establishment-oriented scumbags who'll backstab the MAGA movement like their previous cabinet predecessors did, especially when the going gets tough. 

The Trump team is again caving into media pressure exactly like the 2017 Trump team before them did. 

People like Matt Gaetz should be the bare minimum nominee standard. Even if it means going to war with the REPUBLICAN run senate.

If you don't hold this Admin’s feet to the fire, then no one will. And now, there's even disturbing reports that the current admin is now reneging on their campaign promise to pardon the J6ers.

The world is now clinging onto hope of a ripple effect in regaining democracy and freedoms... now that Trump has global influence!

Anyone been issued a gag-order like Tommy mentions? I have, for 4 years!!! Silenced against exposing corruption, collusion and making the mistake of 'speaking out' in 'matters' involving minors! 

Although my personal experience is vastly different than Tommy's, it's all rooted in the same evil Government Agencies, paid-off Judges and 'others' that conspire to destroy lives! 

My story cost me my life, my freedoms AND worst of all, placed children in danger!
