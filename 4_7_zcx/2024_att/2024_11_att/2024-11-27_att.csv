So, it turns out, after all of Biden's fear-mongering about Trump supporters and the imaginary threat they pose to America, radicals are calling in bomb threats to Trump's cabinet officials and their families.

At least 11 Trump cabinet members or elected officials have been threatened so far, according to reports.

Among those who have been targeted: @MattGaetz, @EliseStefanik, @LeeZeldin, @JohnRatcliffe, and @PeteHegseth. 

This is a ""disruption to the peaceful transition of power.""

It is a denial of the legitimacy of the Nov. 5 election, thereby making it ""election interference.""

It is an attempt to use threats of violence to influence the government, also making it ""terrorism.""

And it is an organized effort to incite or participate in rebellion against the constitutionally established government, its processes and institutions, or the rule of law. Thus, it is a form of ""insurrection.""

Where is the condemnation of these ""attacks on democracy""?

Because so far there has been a striking media reaction to these threats of violence against Donald Trump and his supporters.

Let‚Äôs see what our professional bootlicker for the administration has to offer today:

‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs greatest foreign policy victory‚Äù

Oh, really? A prisoner swap, orchestrated over years (likely beginning under Trump‚Äôs administration), is suddenly Biden‚Äôs personal victory? Nice try. Let‚Äôs break this down:
‚Ä¢ These kinds of negotiations are handled by diplomats across multiple administrations. Pretending this is uniquely a Biden achievement is like crediting the chef for a meal that took three restaurants to prepare.
‚Ä¢ The China travel advisory downgrade is a joke. This is the same China that threatens Taiwan, steals intellectual property, and floods the U.S. with fentanyl precursors. But sure, exercise caution, folks. That‚Äôll solve everything.

The Prisoner Swap Hypocrisy

Funny how prisoner swaps are celebrated when Democrats are in charge. When Trump secured the release of Americans detained in North Korea, it was painted as him ‚Äúcozying up to dictators.‚Äù But now Biden is somehow a diplomatic genius for a similar move? The selective outrage is delicious.

‚ÄúBiden‚Äôs foreign policy outshines Trump‚Äôs‚Äù

Let‚Äôs look at the scoreboard:
‚Ä¢ Trump‚Äôs Middle East Peace Accords: Historic normalization of relations between Israel and Arab nations.
‚Ä¢ Defeat of ISIS‚Äôs territorial caliphate: Trump‚Äôs leadership obliterated the group‚Äôs hold over the region.
‚Ä¢ Energy independence: Trump‚Äôs policies reduced reliance on foreign adversaries like China and Russia.

Now compare that to Biden:
‚Ä¢ The Afghanistan withdrawal disaster: Hundreds of Americans abandoned, billions in military equipment left behind, and the Taliban back in power.
‚Ä¢ The Ukraine debacle: Billions sent with little accountability, escalating tensions with Russia.
‚Ä¢ The China appeasement: Biden has yet to hold them accountable for COVID origins, espionage, or their aggression in the Pacific.

The Tribel Self-Promotion

It‚Äôs adorable that you‚Äôre using this ‚Äúbreaking news‚Äù as a plug for some obscure social network no one cares about. The desperation is palpable.

Here‚Äôs the reality: Swapping prisoners doesn‚Äôt make Biden a foreign policy mastermind. It‚Äôs basic diplomacy, nothing more. Try harder next time with your propaganda.",Wed Nov 27 18:13:59 +0000 2024,0.11570216049382716,Support

They've escalated from riots and protests to Swatting, and let's call it what it is: 

These are not just pranks, they are death threats aimed at our President-elect Donald Trump's appointees and incoming Cabinet members

Here's the harsh truth: swatting isn't some harmless game. It's a tactic deployed by the radical elements within the left-wing cult that's been emboldened over the years. These incidents are designed to provoke a lethal response from law enforcement, putting lives at risk. It's a game of Russian roulette with real bullets.

You might remember the two assassination attempts on President Trump this year. Those weren't isolated incidents; they're part of a pattern. This swatting spree against Trump's team is cut from the same cloth. It's the same violent cult mentality, the same hatred, the same refusal to accept reality that drives these acts. They lost. They cannot take it.  We wrote the first book on them:  BULLETPROOF. 

We spent all day yesterday warning about leftist reprisals. 

Look at these leftists and their violent rhetoric on BlueSky 

Let's break this down:

Targeted Harassment: Swatting is a direct threat to the lives of our leaders. It's not just about disruption; it's about causing harm, potentially fatal harm, through fear and tactical deceit

Echoes of Violence: This is the same playbook from the radicals who thought they could end Trump's life to end his policies. Two attempts already, and now they're switching tactics, but the intent is the same

The Left's War on Democracy: When you can't win at the polls, you attack the players. It's a strategy born out of desperation, a belief that their 'right' to power overrides the rule of law and basic human decency.

Imagine, being an incoming Cabinet member or an appointee, trying to serve your country, only to have your family awakened by armed police in the dead of night, all because someone decided your political alignment was their personal target. It's not just irresponsible; it's a direct assault on American governance.

We must see these swatting incidents for what they are: an extension of the cancel culture that has graduated from social media shaming to physical intimidation. The left has weaponized every tool at their disposal, including law enforcement, to push their agenda.

America, this is a wake-up call. We need to protect our public servants, not just for their sake, but for the sake of our democracy. The left's violent cult mentality has been unchecked for too long. They've gone from words to actions, from protests to swatting, and from that to outright assassination attempts.

We need to stand up, speak out, and demand accountability. This isn't about politics; it's about preserving the peace and safety that we, as Americans, deserve. Swatting isn't just a crime; it's an act of terrorism when directed at our leaders.

A deflated-looking Vice President Kamala Harris reemerged on Tuesday, filming a quick video message for her supporters that was posted on the X account for the Democratic Party.

'I just have to remind you, don't you ever let anybody take your power from you. You have the same power that you did before November 5th,' she said, referencing the date of the presidential election that she lost to President-elect Donald Trump.

In the past three weeks, Trump has gotten his transition going by naming a flurry of Cabinet appointees.

Earlier Tuesday, his team announced they had ended a transition stalemate¬†with the Biden White House.

Harris, in the meantime, had¬†decamped to Hawaii for a post-election-loss vacation and then arrived in the Bay Area Monday to spend Thanksgiving break among family.

She was dressed in work-wear for the video in what appeared to be a living room and looked bleary-eyes as she delivered the 28-second message.

'And you have the same purpose that you did. And you have the same ability to engage and inspire,' she continued. 'So don't ever let anybody or any circumstance take your power from you.'

It's unclear what prompted the VP to deliver the pep talk, though online commenters suggested she wasn't sober.

'Have you been drinking?' asked actor Kevin Sorbo, in an X post replying to the Democrat's video.

'Ooof she looks rough. Couple too many drinks?' another¬†commenter said.

Harris and her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, spent six days at a $1,300-a-night vacation property on Hawaii's big island, rarely venturing out in public, https://t.co/wltvSpLrgz reported on Monday.

The home was a 5,200 sq. ft, five-bedroom propery owned by a scion of the Mondavi wine family.

And according to the online listing, the rental included 'three complimentary bottles of Mondavi family wine with every reservation.'

From a small-town girl

Mr. President, congratulations on your historic win of the 2024 election. I believe it proved that you also won the 2020 election, unless the fraud that is still occurring is muddying the waters for the true results.

I am really just a small-town girl that has supported you since 2016. I believed you when you told us that you were not a politician that you were there to clean up the swamp and return this country back to us ‚Äúthe people‚Äù. I still want to believe these words.

I am a January 6 defendant who has been tried and convicted of misdemeanor charges occurring on that day. I came there with the excitement of seeing and hearing you. When I arrived in DC, I had simple things that I cherished in my life. I had family, friends, a job, a business, a reputation for helping others and survival of the many hurdles that I have been challenged with over my 67 years on this earth.

Today, most of those things have been damaged by the results of that day.

Recently, you had all of your charges dropped. You have your exciting life, your home, your friends, your family, a presidency to look forward to. Many are whispering in your ear to ‚Äúnot spend your political capitol on the January 6th issue‚Äù. I must say it disgusts me that we are referred to as ‚Äúpolitical capitol‚Äù ‚Äì we are a big part of what has helped you achieve what you have achieved today! We supported you, voted for you, those who supported us did the same.
We are more than ‚Äúpolitical capitol‚Äù we are patriots that have stood with you ‚Äúproudly‚Äù!

Please do not abandon us. I realize that the little things that mean so much to me, probably are not of your concern or understanding, but they are the things that I worked hard over my life to achieve. They are VERY important to me.

Just yesterday, I was asked to resign from my employment due to the findings and my sentencing for January 6. Another loss that has cut deep. Now I am left with my social security which will cease when I start my imprisonment.

We are counting on you Mr. President to do for us, what has been done for you. To stand with us and end this nightmare for ALL!

Sincerely,
Cindy Lou Young
