1) It's less likely we'll see legislation to push tax penalties on single-family rental investors. Also, the author of that Harris-endorsed legislation (Brown) lost re-election.

2) It's less likely we'll see expansion of the Low Income Housing Tax Credit program, though not totally off the board. (Just not something Trump has talked about.) Also more likely we could see HUD budget cuts, as Trump proposed in his first time.

3) We could see some federal lands repurposed for housing construction with ""ultra-low regulation"" as Trump has repeatedly pitched.

4) We could see a big bipartisan push to remove regulatory roadblocks to housing construction. Lots of folks forget this, but Trump did launch the ""White House Council on Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing"" -- targeting zoning, rent controls, building codes, impact fees, parking requirements, environmental reviews, etc. -- ""because for many American citizens, the supply of available housing has not kept pace with the demand for housing by prospective renters and homebuyers.‚Äù But it wasn't launched until late in his presidency (2019) so it didn't get anywhere and it appears Biden Admin dropped it. Trump has also killed zoning ""a killer,"" but at the same time, he probably won't go as far as YIMBYs want -- opposing to upzoning existing single-family neighborhoods.

5) We could see higher construction costs (likely leading to higher rents/prices for new construction, which in turn could make some construction less viable) if Trump pushes higher tariffs on materials as he's proposed. And if he does somehow push through a deportation program, that would have a dramatic impact on construction labor (with immigrants representing large share of construction workforce) -- putting further upward pressure on costs. This could be a big headwind to supply if it plays out.

6) As @DallasAptGP has pointed out, we could see extension/expansion of the Opportunity Zone program (which Trump signed into law in 2017 and resulted in significant boost to apartment construction in those zones.

7) What will Trump do with Fannie and Freddie? It seems less likely we'll see a Trump Administration try to regulate apartments via the GSEs as the Biden Administration did or a push (as some made) to attach rent control with agency debt. Could we see Trump try to re-privatize Fannie and Freddie? And if so, could that result in (modestly) higher cost of capital but lesser risk of ""strings attached""?

8) Friendly reminder: Regardless who won this election, we were highly likely to see multifamily supply decline over the next presidential term. It's not for lack of trying. It's just that it takes time to get new housing built, and the current pipeline (plunging starts) points to reduced supply environment in 2026-27. Any impact from new policies will likely take 2-3 years to result in meaningful volumes of completed supply.",Wed Nov 06 19:30:55 +0000 2024,0.098258559622196,Support

However, it feels as if we are tiptoeing around an important definition of the American-European relation, and that is that since WWII the US has taken upon itself a leadership role and is now finally backing out of it.

This dynamic was not forceful or autocratic in nature, it was based on mutual interests, respect, shared values and a common foe - the USSR. But the relationship dynamic has not been symmetrical, the US was in front.

When that common foe internally disintegrated, not by being defeated by the West, rather through its own contradictions, Europe strengthened its internal ties and even created a competing common currency to the dollar.

While Europe started to shyly envision itself as a consolidated block, the US started to shift its focus to different regions. Beginning with the Middle East and ending with the Pacific.

Europe expected to get security from the US in the same manner as in the Cold War era, while trying to leave the US shadow in the economic sphere. The US received the bad end of the deal, basically.

Finally, when a dangerous foe once again appeared in Europe, the US wasn't interested enough to invest itself fully. Not Bush in 2008 when Russia attacked Georgia, not Obama in 2014 when Russia attacked Ukraine. In fact, for all the shortcomings of his strategy, Biden was the last US president very much interested in Europe.

Trump will pull out of the leadership role vis-a-vis Europe and institute a mercantile relationship, quid pro quo. Therefore, Europe need not awake from some theoretical slumber, the US will not treat it any better than it treats the rest of the world (in some cases, especially with Trump's deals with dictators, it may even receive worse treatment).

The previous relationship with the US gave Europe a feeling of a moral superiority only a victim in an uneven relationship can have - the US is in charge, its to blame for everything that goes wrong and its to pick up the tab when need be. Europe is just a secondary actor.

All the talk coming from Western Europe about strategic autonomy was in fact posturing in belief that the US finds it necessary to retain its leadership role. It was an act - ""the US must provide what we need, or we'll leave."" In the end, it was the US they finally left.

No need to awake, this is our reality now. Europe either takes care of itself, or it gest bullied from different sides - Russia from the east, energy exporting countries from the south and American corporation capital from the west.

Europe got what it wanted, no more Americans domineering, no more pointing the finger of blame to the unruly cowboy in the corner, we are alone, completely alone, which may also be interpreted from a more positive viewpoint - we are our own.

Trump took the win, racking up 277 Electoral College votes‚Äîand that‚Äôs with five states still on deck. He‚Äôs on track for a landslide 312-228 sweep over Kamala.

Kamala? She‚Äôs been radio silent since the results started rolling in. She skipped her planned speech at Howard University; not the night her supporters were hoping for.

Trump‚Äôs victory speech hit all the notes: a promise to unite the country, end wars, and rebuild a healthy America. With Elon and RFK Jr. on board it's exciting times ahead.

Congrats are flooding in from world leaders. They're ready to roll with Trump 2.0. Iran? Not phased, but bracing for sanctions, as usual.

And it‚Äôs not just the presidency‚Äîthe Republicans locked down the Senate and are inching toward House control. Full GOP power shift incoming?

Meanwhile, in Russia, a wave of Ukrainian drones struck a Russian fleet in the Caspian Sea. That‚Äôs a thousand kilometers past the frontline‚ÄîUkraine showing its reach.

Hezbollah‚Äôs Sheikh Naim Qassem is set to go live with his thoughts on Trump‚Äôs win at 3 p.m. local time. Expect some loaded words.

Elon was right there at Mar-a-Lago with Trump, calling it a ‚Äúcrystal clear mandate for change.‚Äù The media is going wild.

In Valencia, Spain‚Äôs military is still combing through the aftermath of deadly flash floods. At least 217 lives lost, and nearly 90 people remain unaccounted for. Heartbreaking scenes.

That‚Äôs your 12-hour news recap! Stay tuned for more updates @MarioNawfal",Wed Nov 06 23:41:17 +0000 2024,0.17006919847828939,Support

‚ÄúOver the last few weeks and through Election Day, millions of Americans cast their votes - not just for president, but for leaders at every level. Now the results are in, and we want to congratulate President Trump and Senator Vance on their victory.
This is obviously not the outcome we had hoped for, given our profound disagreements with the Republican ticket on a whole host of issues. But living in a democracy is about recognizing that our point of view won't always win out, and being willing to accept the peaceful transfer of power.
Michelle and I could not be prouder of Vice President Harris and Governor Walz - two extraordinary public servants who ran a remarkable campaign. And we will always be grateful to the staff and volunteers who poured their heart and soul into electing public servants they truly believed in.
As I said on the campaign trail, America has been through a lot over the last few years - from a historic pandemic and price hikes resulting from the pandemic, to rapid change and the feeling a lot of folks have that, no matter how hard they work, treading water is the best they can do. Those conditions have created headwinds for democratic incumbents around the world, and last night showed that America is not immune.
The good news is that these problems are solvable - but only if we listen to each other, and only if we abide by the core constitutional principles and democratic norms that made this country great.
In a country as big and diverse as ours, we won't always see eye-to-eye on everything. But progress requires us to extend good faith and grace - even to people with whom we deeply disagree. That's how we've come this far, and it's how we'll keep building a country that is more fair and more just, more equal and more free.‚Äù",Wed Nov 06 22:57:00 +0000 2024,0.2426470588235294,Support

But they‚Äôre wrong. Trump‚Äôs comeback is the American comeback. Our nation deserves a badass Commander-in-Chief right now & that‚Äôs exactly what we got. Funny how well our democracy actually works.",Wed Nov 06 20:46:43 +0000 2024,0.16925770308123247,Support

1. It was based on a lie. Access to abortion was going to be the same regardless of which candidate won. The Supreme Court ruled that abortion law was a matter for individual states TWO years ago. Trump's policy is to leave it as a matter for states to decide & he stated many times there would be NO federal abortion ban. Harris' has done nothing for TWO years to improve access despite being the VP. There is no indication that she had any plan except to wait for room on the Supreme Court to install a pro-abortion judge to ensure a challenge would get through. This would likely take years. 
2. It was never going to entice soft Republicans to jump ship.
3. Many Democrats & Independents are pro-life and by focusing so closely on abortion they were alienated from her campaign.
4. Also alienates many minorities who are more likely to have religious beliefs e.g. Black, Arabic, and Latino communities.
5. Many women will never have an abortion or see abortion as something that happens only when something has gone very wrong, and while they care about it, life is so tough that they are likely to vote for matters more pressing and immediate to their survival.
6. The Democrats have been appalling on other aspects of women's rights because they believe men can declare themselves to be women. They have destroyed Title IX, put men in women's prisons, and refuse to acknowledge what a woman is. It can be viewed as hypocritical. 
7. The attempt to start a movement of dads voting for their daughter's to have access to abortion seems alright on the surface but only to their base who votes for them already. Other dads (rightly or wrongly) do not want to think about their daughters having sex and getting accidentally pregnant. They may agree with abortion access but are uncomfortable with the thought of their daughter needing it.
8. The issue became so aggressively and hyperbolically discussed in media and online to the extent that more extreme views of no-term-limit abortions were being demanded and some women were bragging about how many abortions they have had. The activist madness then put off moderates who associated it with all the other woke issues that are irritating people.
9. Kamala spent so much time on this and demonising Trump that she did not offer an alternative vision and solutions to the real problems that Americans were saying mattered to them.
10. Many states have legalised (or are in the process of legalising) access to abortion already. Given Trump's assurances that the Federal Govt won't get involved the women of those states may feel confident to focus on other issues.
11. People could see through the scaremongering. 

There are probably many other reasons I have missed. I am personally pro-choice but see it as a very serious decision not a form of contraception. I was disgusted by the scaremongering and out right lies. She centred her campaign on the lie that Trump was going to take immediate action to ban all abortions and she was going to reverse the SC decision on Roe V Wade which she cannot do.",Wed Nov 06 20:07:57 +0000 2024,0.016594516594516596,Support

White Women are NOT the cause of Europe's Destruction, stop blaming White Women and let us all just be a TEAM and save Our beautiful White Race and Our White Nations, keep ProCreating White babies and to ban n0n-whites from ever entering and being in Our White Nations.

We can't make Europe etc White Again if White Men AND White Women are not a Team and in this Fight together.

The jews are not just attacking you White Men they're attacking White Women as well..

Donald Trump has won. A majority of people voted for him. I am sad and deeply concerned that he will be our next president.

You can‚Äôt love your country only when you win‚Äîand I commend Vice President Kamala Harris for conceding the race with decency and class, unlike Donald Trump who tried to overturn the election four years ago when he lost, and who planned to call it rigged again if the results didn‚Äôt go his way.

Look, this is a painful and disappointing outcome. Like so many of you, I‚Äôm worried. Worried about what this means for the future. Worried for the most vulnerable among us. Worried for our democracy. Worried that people will give up and unplug from politics for the next four years because of how hard this is. But I‚Äôm asking‚Äîplease don‚Äôt give in to despair. We cannot go back, only forward‚Äîand the hard work of protecting America from the most devastating impacts of a second Donald Trump presidency begins today.

Democrats are not defeated. We know what to fight for because we know what we stand for. An economy that works for working people. A government that respects everyone. A positive vision for a better future where we address big problems like climate change, hunger, and poverty. We will work day and night to highlight the sharp contrast between our hopeful vision for the future, and Donald Trump‚Äôs dark desire to drag us back.

Let me end with this. The beauty of democracy is that no defeat is final‚Äîwe will continue to fight for our values and push for progress. Where Democrats can find common ground, we will work together to get things done. Where we cannot, we will stand up for what we believe.

These are the three big reasons

1.The UK and Europe are too dependent on the US military and its defence industry at a time when Putin‚Äôs land grab in Ukraine threatens our security directly and the Middle East tumult risks dangerous escalation - and when Trump talks of securing a fast peace with Putin on terms that could be presented as a victory by the Russian dictator. 

2.The UK and European economies are growing too sluggishly to adequately deliver the living standards and public services demanded by citizens - and Trump‚Äôs threat of swingeing tariffs and a new age of protectionism could turn low growth into perma frost.

3.The cohesion of all our societies are being shaken by a social and digital media that daily challenges truth and fact, and which promotes hysteria, grievance and resentment.  Trump‚Äôs pact with Musk means there is no chance that the digital misinformation beast will be tamed.  The populist far right will be emboldened everywhere. 

There is now a massive geopolitical choice for Starmer.  Does he djtch his cautious incrementalist approach to restoring economic, trade and diplomatic relations with the EU in favour of something that looks more like a big bang? He‚Äôll be under enormous pressure from his supporters, the LibDems and Greens to go much faster than he instinctively wishes to restore trade integration with the EU and build a new security integration.  

Apart from anything else, the UK will now be under intense pressure to increase defence spending.  Quite how that will be affordable is unclear absent a growth boost from securing seamless access once more to the EU‚Äôs single market. 

Or does Starmer stick with relatively timid incrementalism in changes to the EU relationship, and make a brave bet that he can work constructively with an emboldened Trump - who (I am told) admires what he sees as Starmer‚Äôs untrammelled control of parliament while nursing a grievance at what looked to Trump like a coordinated Labour plan to help Kamala Harris.  

Trump has historically been contemptuous of the EU.  He would not be impressed by any perception that Starmer and the UK would choose friendship and loyalty to Brussels, Paris and Berlin over Washington. 

But Starmer will have to choose.",Wed Nov 06 12:26:50 +0000 2024,0.11922587216704862,Support

With the support of the #MAGA movement, Trump‚Äôs 2024 campaign aims to emphasize his previous policy successes and focus on issues like economic growth, border security, and reducing government regulation. This comeback bid is a pivotal moment in U.S. political history, drawing interest from high-profile figures, including Elon Musk, who has taken a renewed interest in political discourse and free speech on his platform, X (formerly Twitter).

Whether Trump‚Äôs campaign succeeds or not, his run is already shaping the 2024 election landscape, influencing conversations about the future of American leadership and policy direction.

Do I (or many/most others on the left) think that the majority of trump supporters are voting for fascism, racism, and misogyny?

OF COURSE NOT.

This was NEVER the argument being made, despite social media's attempts to simplify it down to something as dumb as ""VOTE FOR TRUMP = YOU'RE A NAZI""

ON THE OTHER HAND.

It is a FACT that fascism has historically ridden in on this EXACT SAME trojan horse with these exact same ""sane"" policies out front: populism, economic ""prosperity"", border ""security"", anti-immigration, etc. Even the recent hijacking of ""bro culture"" by the right has echoes of historically terrifying precedent. 

Nobody ever thought that YOU, the trump voter, was/is a fascist. Please, please - especially now - understand this:

It is now YOUR JOB (trump voter) to ENSURE that your vote for these ""sane policies"" you care most about (and I do believe you!), and the politicians promoting those policies as their supposed agenda, do NOT become THE trojan horse that lets fascism right into the front door.

I hope you can also understand why those of us who voted against this are afraid. This is not some abstract concept. You are playing with FIRE. These are almost word-for-word the exact same policies that got Hitler elected, whether you like it or not. He wasn't out there saying ""Vote for me and I'll kill all the jews!!"". That came LATER (and you know that.)

Please, I IMPLORE YOU, if you've read this far and you are a trump voter: WHATEVER HAPPENS NOW IS ON YOU, and I am literally BEGGING you to vehemently defend against the fascists, nazis, etc who HAVE clearly chosen your side as their preferred trojan horse (and the definition of fascism is a ""far right movement"", so that makes sense).

Right-leaning folks: It's your time/turn again now. We'll be watching closely and please know this (although you've clearly been told otherwise by those that profit from our rage and division): We on the left actually DO truly hope that fascism does NOT take over and ride in on the back of far-right populism, as it has many times before in humankind's history. Just like you, we hope for the best, not the worst. We know that practically none of you, individually, woke up and decided to vote for fascism. In fact we desperately hope that you're right, and this is just a conservative ""correction"" on topics such as fiscal policy and border security.

If, on the other hand, it turns out that history is repeating itself... we will NEED you to take a stand before it's too late, if it's not already. We still believe in you, our neighbors, our brothers and sisters, even if you've been told otherwise. We pray WITH you for the same things: our future, our children's future, peace and liberty and freedom, for all.",Wed Nov 06 21:50:29 +0000 2024,0.0006991685563114096,Support

As results trickle in, here's when past presidential races were called:

2020: Biden victory called 4 days later (11:26 AM ET, Nov. 7)

2016: Trump win declared at 2:29 AM ET after Wisconsin

2012: Obama re-election called at 11:38 PM ET on election night

2008: Obama victory announced around 11 PM ET

Tonight's race, with Trump at 230 EVs to Harris's 205, could mirror 2016's early morning call or 2020's extended count, depending on remaining battleground states. 

The decentralized U.S. election system, with thousands of local offices following state standards, means timing can vary significantly.

üî∏Ô∏èLess Regulation:

Trump has shown a crypto-friendly stance in the past, even suggesting he wants to make the USA the ""crypto capital of the world"". This could lead to less stringent regulation, fostering innovation and growth in the cryptocurrency sector.

üî∏Ô∏èPro-Crypto Policies:

Trump has promised during campaign events to be a ""crypto president"". Such statements could encourage investors and developers in the industry, hoping for governmental support and promotion of cryptocurrencies.

üî∏Ô∏èSupport for Bitcoin and Crypto Mining:

Trump announced on X (formerly Twitter) his support for Bitcoin production in the USA and the potential pardon of Ross Ulbricht, which might symbolize a positive stance towards cryptocurrencies. This could boost interest and investment in cryptocurrencies like Pi Network.

üî∏Ô∏èPromotion of Technology:

His attitude could lead to the USA wanting to be at the forefront of blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies, which could benefit innovations like Pi Network in the long run.

üî∏Ô∏èEconomic Policies:

Trump's economic approaches, aiming at tax cuts and deregulation, might create an environment where investments in cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology become more attractive. A strong dollar and economic policies that facilitate investing in digital assets could increase interest in Pi Network and other cryptocurrencies.

üî∏Ô∏èCommunity Support:

A pro-crypto stance from Trump could strengthen the crypto community, leading to more engagement, usage, and acceptance of Pi Network.

However, it's crucial to note that the cryptocurrency landscape is complex and influenced by many factors beyond political decisions. The election of a president is just one piece of a larger puzzle that also includes global regulation, market conditions, and technological developments.

Democrats need to finally accept that the days of hugging trees are over. I have said this so many times on my shows over the last few years. We need to get tougher, stronger, smarter, more ruthless, more bad ass and more ‚Äúmuscular‚Äù, for lack of a better term, with our messaging to get thru to these voting blocs again.

This kumbaya shit needs to go out the window. Clinton smartly did this in the 90s and Obama did it to a degree as well. We can still believe in creating a loving, compassionate, more accepting  and caring world, but we need to verbally smack these motherfuckers around, fight dirty and not play footsies during VP debates like Walz did with Vance. Biden was too old. Kamala was too nice. 

We must embrace elements of this new political reality. We may not like, but it needs to be done. Because now we must fight on two fronts. Keeping the core of the base intact with our policies and beliefs that appeal to them on one front AND step the fuck up to savagely go toe to toe with these Republicans in debates, in the media, in speeches and in interviews to convince voters that we are strong and we‚Äôll fight for them.

We need to listen to the working class and their needs from the local elections on up to the top. We need to engage in local politics much more aggressively than we do. We need groups within our base to understand that all their politically correct needs cannot be met every time they need to have them met. We need to get them to understand that there‚Äôs a bigger picture here. And we need to find louder and stronger voices on the airwaves, on social media and in print. We won‚Äôt win another election if all we have is identity politics and a ‚Äúfuck it, you deal with it‚Äù attitude. 

I hope we can find the right people to deliver these messages and to fight with every ounce of strength they have to win back the voters we‚Äôve lost here. Because if we don‚Äôt, we might never win a general election again.",Wed Nov 06 19:02:05 +0000 2024,0.0616983791402396,Support

This is how you can see President Trump's landslide victory through the U.S. national horoscope which I've shown below in my ""Russo version"" which I believe is the most accurate lens to perceive U.S. national astrological events (superior to the Sibly chart). 

If you're awake then you know that this is, in fact, President Trump's third time winning a U.S. presidential election. How profound it is that the U.S. Mars at 21¬∞ Gemini numerologically reduces the the number three (2+1=3) while it also matches Trump's sign of Gemini.

As I've been teaching, the 9th house governs politics, campaigns and political events in general. What we are seeing is a perfect and profound correspondence between the U.S. Mars at 21¬∞ Gemini and President Trump, the Gemini, winning three great elections.

Mars is a masculine planet so when perceived through the U.S. chart one can interpret ""male Gemini"" being central to mega events in the U.S. 9th house realm of politics. President Trump, the great political warrior, embodies the national archetype of Mars in Gemini. 

While I've shown many Trump victory signs through previous analysis (see our highlights section) I have held this one back until now. For those who are curious, this is how you see Trump winning at the national level. I don't know why every leftist astrologer missed this but they did. It's big and obvious but TDS is debilitating. 

Batting 1,000,000 in U.S. national astrology,
