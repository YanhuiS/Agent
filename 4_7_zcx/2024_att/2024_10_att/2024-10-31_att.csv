Trump will most likely win the election, but lose the popular vote. This will cause lots of butthurt, but it's expected because Harris heavily appeals to the coastal liberal mentality ( +24 in CA ) but doesn't have as wide of support as Trump has. And the reality is the EC is what matters. She can still win and there is definitely a realistic chance this could swing either way, but Trump just has a bit more wiggle room in the Electoral College.

 Her only chance lies in the fact that these states are polling only slightly in favor of Trump, so she only needs to take some away from Trump to win. But Trump doesn't need to take any of her ""leans"" states to win, and that's a big oof.

( I base these results by looking at multiple polls and going by the number of polls that favor a candidate, while slightly weighing against certain pollsters known to be consistently wrong. )",Thu Oct 31 23:53:34 +0000 2024,0.14307359307359307,Support

1. **Economic Growth**: Supporters argue his policies like tax cuts and deregulation spurred economic growth and job creation, which they want to see reinstated.

 2. **America First**: His foreign policy focused on prioritizing U.S. interests, reducing international commitments, and renegotiating trade deals, which appeals to those advocating for a stronger national stance.

3.**Border Security**: Trump's tough stance on immigration, including border wall construction, resonates with voters concerned about illegal immigration's effects on jobs and security.

4. **Cultural Standpoint**: He represents a pushback against progressive cultural shifts, appealing to those who wish to preserve traditional American values and oppose perceived ""woke"" ideologies.

5. **Judicial Influence**: His appointments to the judiciary, especially the Supreme Court, are seen as crucial for conservative legal interpretations.

6. **Electoral Integrity**: Trump's focus on what his supporters see as necessary reforms to prevent election fraud.

7. **Political Retribution**: His return could be viewed as a vindication against what his base perceives as unfair political and legal targeting.

8. **Dissatisfaction**: Many supporters feel the current administration has failed on multiple fronts, from economic to foreign policy, believing Trump's return would correct these issues.

 9. **Populism**: Trump's direct communication style and outsider image continue to attract those disillusioned with traditional politics.

10. **Personal Appeal**: His charisma, branding, and promises of efficiency in governance remain a strong draw for his voter base.

On behalf of the great people of New Mexico, I will end Kamala's war on American energy. They, you're not going to have any energy. You know, they talk about PA, no fracking. They're going to, if you don't have energy, they're going to take it away. They want to go all electric. Everything, all electric, oh, that's going to be wonderful. They want even in the military. They want all electric army tanks. There's only one problem. They don't work. But they will be environmentally friendly as you blast your way into various enemy cities, right? We'll do it. And we will blast our way through into a city and environmentally friendly way. You know what happens? The battery is so big and so heavy that you will have to carry it in like a wagon in the back. Okay? They'll be pulling a battery along in a wagon and the battery's so heavy. They don't even know if the tank is going to have the power to do it. The whole thing is crazy. It doesn't go far. It doesn't have the right torque. These are minor details. The whole tank is so heavy that if it goes over a bridge, you're going to have to rebuild all the bridges. Same thing with the trucks. They want to make all trucks, all trucks, all electric. The problem is they weigh 2 1/2 times more because of the battery. They don't go far enough. And because of the weight, by the way, it would mean we would have to build and rebuild every bridge in the United States of America has to be rebuilt to handle the weight of all electric trucks. I said to the head of the truck, or one guy's 28,000 trucks. I said, that's a lot. He's been buying him his whole life. He said, I've been buying trucks for 50 years, sir. And every year they got better, bigger, stronger, more beautiful. We build those apartments on the back of that trailer right now. So you'd be proud to live in one of them. I said, I don't know about that. I'm not sure. Maybe I would. I probably would. They're beautiful, you see. But every year, he said, for 50 years, they've got more efficient. They've gotten better. And now they want us to go all electric. And we'd be going back 50 years and much more 50 years ago, truck was better than the best electric truck today. So I said, did you explain that to the authorities as they burst into your office to demand that you go all electric? I explained it. What they say, we don't give a damn. We want you to go all electric. This is what we're dealing with. It's like gestapo stuff. They use that term. It's like gestapo stuff. What they're doing to our country is unbelievable. And you talk about a supply chain. I said, how many stops would you have to make for electric six? The LA, NY to LA 6 stops are. And we have no chargers. I said, that's a problem too. Do you know they built eight charging stations? You know what a charging station? It's the same thing as the pump with gasoline, except electric is there. It comes to you. You put it in, right? Do you hear the story? $9 billion they've spent for eight charging stations in the mid-west. So you're about ready to run out of electric and they say, sir, if you go 300 miles to the north, there's a charging station up there. It would cost us to do the necessary charging stations. It would cost us, they say, about $10T. That's like $10T to do the necessary. And you know what? I'm not against electric. I think they're incredible. I think they have a purpose.

If i believed that American presidents had a chance to truly change the country's foreign policy, i would be very excited about Trump/Vance victory. One side is sensible and human, the other is fake and gay. It's a no-brainer. However, if the system is bicameral and the president exists mostly in the media sphere, and the octopus continues to do its own thing, then Trump's success would be detrimental to Russia and other countries in the same position.

Trump's victory is good for the American international prestige. Some European libs might be mad, but who cares. Imagine a scenario where the US continue their typical activities, such as setting up NGOs, shipping weapons, and conducting CIA ops, while a globally popular and controversial president offsets it with his bombastic media presence. That could be a very dangerous and misleading combo. ""There are only two genders, folks"" - Trump says from a flat screen TV, as the young banderite girls are getting pumped with trenbolone in Kharkov to become the new FtM suicide squad financed by US taxpayers. I mean, that's more or less what was going on in the Ukraine under Trump in 2016-2020 already.

If the situation really as bleak as i imagine it, then the United States needs to be seen as worthless, stupid, and weak - for the sake of the world's well-being. In other words ""it's Kamala time baby"". Sometimes, a bitter truth may be better than a sweet lie. I sincerely hope I am wrong about this - but all the previous US presidents were quite disappointing. They couldn't deliver on what they promised. They are conforming to the deep state and the already existing ""national interests"", and not the other way around. It will require a miracle to seriously change this rusty ol' system through democratic means and the chances are pretty low.",Thu Oct 31 19:30:15 +0000 2024,0.030115283267457174,Support

The 2024 United States presidential election is set for November 5, 2024, featuring a contest between Kamala Harris of the Democratic Party and Donald Trump of the Republican Party. Here are some key points and updates based on the information available up to October 31, 2024:

Current Polling and Trends: Recent polls indicate a very tight race nationally and in key swing states. Kamala Harris has maintained a slight lead over Donald Trump in national polls since entering the race, but this lead has been narrowing. In swing states, the polls are so close that neither candidate has a significant edge, with some states showing slight leads for either candidate at different times.

Voter Turnout: Reports suggest that around 60 million Americans have already voted through early voting or mail-in ballots, which is significant given the election date is still a few days away. This high turnout could be influenced by the contentious nature of the election and various legal challenges faced by Trump.

1. **Economic Growth**: Supporters argue his policies like tax cuts and deregulation spurred economic growth and job creation, which they want to see reinstated.

 2. **America First**: His foreign policy focused on prioritizing U.S. interests, reducing international commitments, and renegotiating trade deals, which appeals to those advocating for a stronger national stance.

3.**Border Security**: Trump's tough stance on immigration, including border wall construction, resonates with voters concerned about illegal immigration's effects on jobs and security.

4. **Cultural Standpoint**: He represents a pushback against progressive cultural shifts, appealing to those who wish to preserve traditional American values and oppose perceived ""woke"" ideologies.

5. **Judicial Influence**: His appointments to the judiciary, especially the Supreme Court, are seen as crucial for conservative legal interpretations.

6. **Electoral Integrity**: Trump's focus on what his supporters see as necessary reforms to prevent election fraud.

7. **Political Retribution**: His return could be viewed as a vindication against what his base perceives as unfair political and legal targeting.

8. **Dissatisfaction**: Many supporters feel the current administration has failed on multiple fronts, from economic to foreign policy, believing Trump's return would correct these issues.

 9. **Populism**: Trump's direct communication style and outsider image continue to attract those disillusioned with traditional politics.

10. **Personal Appeal**: His charisma, branding, and promises of efficiency in governance remain a strong draw for his voter base.

1. **Economic Growth**: Supporters argue his policies like tax cuts and deregulation spurred economic growth and job creation, which they want to see reinstated.

 2. **America First**: His foreign policy focused on prioritizing U.S. interests, reducing international commitments, and renegotiating trade deals, which appeals to those advocating for a stronger national stance.

3.**Border Security**: Trump's tough stance on immigration, including border wall construction, resonates with voters concerned about illegal immigration's effects on jobs and security.

4. **Cultural Standpoint**: He represents a pushback against progressive cultural shifts, appealing to those who wish to preserve traditional American values and oppose perceived ""woke"" ideologies.

5. **Judicial Influence**: His appointments to the judiciary, especially the Supreme Court, are seen as crucial for conservative legal interpretations.

6. **Electoral Integrity**: Trump's focus on what his supporters see as necessary reforms to prevent election fraud.

7. **Political Retribution**: His return could be viewed as a vindication against what his base perceives as unfair political and legal targeting.

8. **Dissatisfaction**: Many supporters feel the current administration has failed on multiple fronts, from economic to foreign policy, believing Trump's return would correct these issues.

 9. **Populism**: Trump's direct communication style and outsider image continue to attract those disillusioned with traditional politics.

10. **Personal Appeal**: His charisma, branding, and promises of efficiency in governance remain a strong draw for his voter base.

Kamala is a puppet of Anti-Hindu globalist olygarchy, and Trump is an enemy of the Globalist olygarchy. 

Yes, his supporters include a few very unpleasant racists and Christian fanatics who have targeted Hindus. However, he is himself not a racist or Christian fanatic. Those people are also mostly limited to social media and the internet. Besides, as things stand, it's unlikely that those racists will have any say in the governance of America if Donald Trump wins. The Christians will have some say, but it will be limited, and their influence will be much lesser compared to a regular republican presidency(See how Trumps stance on abortion etc).

On the other hand, anti-Hindu activists on the democrat side will have a lot of say in government policy if Kamala Harris wins. Subversive activities of the American deepstate or globalist olygarchy targeting India will intensify under a Kamala presidency while it will decrease under a Trump presidency. We saw this in the first term of Trump. 

Regime change operations aimed at unseating Modi, bringing Congress to power, and persecuting Hindutvavaadis will intensify if Kamala wins. A Trump presidency will be better for Indian sovereignty.

Some people have raised concerns about possible deportation of Indians etc if Trump wins. But, legal immigrants are unlikely to face any problems. Even if Trump succeeds in cracking down on immigration(the liberal bureaucracy will put up hurdles), it will be targeted at illegal immigrants. H1B visas may decrease slightly, but thats it.

I cast my first vote for Mr. Trump. Enthusiastically. 

NGL, it was emotional not being able to check off Kennedy. But this is reality. This is adulting. This is the way. It was always about policies and not just the presidency. 

Like many Kennedy supporters, it was no easy journey. As someone with an Obama, Obama, HRC, Biden record and a good case of TDS, it did not happen overnight or without heavy research and engagement. 

I began regretting my 2020 vote once the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal commenced. I began questioning the conventional thinking about the Ukraine conflict. 

Vivek caught my eye initially. but once it was clear that this was still Trump‚Äôs show I lost hope. Then, the 2024 Super Bowl. RFK‚Äôs amazing ad caught my attention. I knew little except the standard lies about him (which I assumed were true). It quickly became clear he was the best candidate of my lifetime. His disillusionment with the 2 party system, his focus on the BIG issues, and his shear brilliance gave me renewed hope for our republic‚Äôs future. I soon learned how difficult the journey would be with the full force of the DNC‚Äôs anti democratic machine deployed. They tried to silence him, to ignore his supporters and the issues we care about. I spent hours gathering ballot signatures, and it was clear the movement had legs. Over 1 million signatures, 50 state access, an unprecedented movement.

When Kennedy suspended his campaign it hit hard. I had to take a break and watch it play out. His introduction at Trump‚Äôs rally was spectacular, but I had concerns Trump would just use Bobby and eventually sideline him. 

But what they had in common united them. What the DNC-MSM did to his campaign is exactly what they have been doing to Trump for years. 

The Rogan interview was the icing; Trump is a fascinating and consequential American leader. 

Actions speak louder than words. It is now clear. A vote for TRUMP is a vote for giving Kennedy the sword he needs to take on the head of the hydra directly.

Vote today, vote tomorrow, vote 11/5, but strongly consider a vote for Trump

There are 2 reasons to vote:
1. It increases the chance that your preferred politician will win.
2. It sends a message to politicians. And that message hits them where it hurts.

If I vote for Trump I‚Äôm sending the message that I‚Äôm happy to vote for a politician who already had one crack at being president and failed miserably. He ran record-breaking deficits, increased taxes in the form of tariffs, ended exactly zero wars, continued Obama‚Äôs policy of prosecuting whistleblowers and turned the country over to Fauci during COVID. Inflation is partially Trump‚Äôs fault because of his insane spending. And he promises to do even worse next time. Deporting millions of workers and hiking tariffs further will be terrible for the economy. Not to mention, deporting peaceful people is heinous.

If I vote for Harris I send the message that all you need to do to earn my vote is yell ‚Äúorange man bad‚Äù enough times.

If I vote for @ChaseForLiberty I send this message:
1. I‚Äôm an engaged citizen who will put in the effort to vote. 
2. Neither of these candidates are good enough to earn my vote. Do better next time.
3. Do better by adopting Chase‚Äôs signature policies. Policies like peace in the Middle East. A border policy that doesn‚Äôt violate basic human rights and is good for the economy. Deregulate. Cut spending.

I want to send those messages to both parties. Much more than I want Trump or Kamala to win.

By the way, I live in a swing state. My vote is up for grabs next time around. You just need to earn it.",Thu Oct 31 18:23:29 +0000 2024,0.04415584415584417,Support
