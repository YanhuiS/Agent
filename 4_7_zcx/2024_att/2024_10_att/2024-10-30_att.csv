üßµ1: The Intellectualist, after reviewing data from trusted sources like Marist, YouGov, Monmouth, and Emerson, believes Kamala Harris is positioned to become the next President of the United States.   

This forecast comes from a model that carefully weighs what voters care about most: candidate approval ratings, top issues (especially the economy), demographic support, expected turnout, and the overall national mood.   

To check the model‚Äôs reliability, The Intellectualist backtested it on past elections (2018, 2020, and 2022) and found that its predictions closely matched actual results.   This strong alignment gives additional confidence in Harris‚Äôs projected edge.

I can‚Äôt predict who will win but it absolutely can happen ‚Ä¶even likely if we look at some polls. 

I want to give them a perspective that it‚Äôs not as bad as they think. Sure when your team doesn‚Äôt win it hurts and the prospect of having to deal with Trump for 4 more yeahs is nauseating. I sympathize. But let‚Äôs step back and view the landscape with a calm mind shall we.

Let‚Äôs start with the issues you care about

Abortion - every blue state can kill babies as usual so no change these. Trump has clearly said red states with pro life laws need to redo their laws and other than late term abortions he is ok with all baby murder. So about 95% of babies can still be killed.

Transgender surgeries - adults can do what they want. Kids can have this barbaric surgery with parents approval and it‚Äôs state issue anyways as the Feds won‚Äôt touch it. Other than a few red states which have put restrictions you can keep mutilating kids.

LGBTQ issues generally. Nothing will change here. The only opposition is to men in women‚Äôs sports so that may be the only change if it even happens.

Spending - all you want in spending will go on. Johnson has already said we will never shut down the government which means with more than 40 senators ( you will have about 48) you can run the show and spending for all your agenda will go on. The massive deficit spending will go on as now.

Health care - Trump won‚Äôt touch it and  you own this issue forever 

Immigration and illegal aliens - Here Trump certainly has rhetoric you guys don‚Äôt like but he won‚Äôt do much in office. On the edges he will be a little stricter on the border. He may deport some harsh criminals but this lie that he will deport 10 million will never happen. He has promised green cards to every foreign student and wants to be liked and can easily be manipulated to give even more amnesty. 

Judges - this is a valid concern. On balance he will appoint judges you don‚Äôt like BUT at least half cave once in office and become leftists so the pain won‚Äôt be really bad. In the court if 2 republicans retire he will replace them with 2 RINO‚Äôs so the court overall becomes less conservative.

Foreign policy - he may do some things you don‚Äôt like but the military industrial complex will go on largely as now. No there won‚Äôt be world peace and most conflicts will go on like now. He may be a little more pro Israel than Biden so that maybe a lump of coal you have to swallow. 

He has RFK and Tulsi and other leftists in his inner circle and his cabinet will be worse than the first term and be Trump sycophants with little other skill. A lot of your own people will be in the Trump government thanks for Tulsi and RFK Jr.

Now the plus side

The economic malaise coming next year can be hung around Trump‚Äôs neck.

He will complete the purge of conservatives in the GOP from federal to local level to near extinction. The GOP will be a party of populists with no core beliefs. 

You win 2026 mid terms

By 2028 the country will hate Trump and the GOP with a red hot nuclear passion and you win 2028 easily.

You can run against Trump up and down the ticket and keep winning elections for decades.

The single biggest win - Trump will move the overton window for what‚Äôs conservative to the left of Obama 2008 and that will be the new normal. You would have won the culture war in effect. 

So yeah it will hurt that your candidate lost Trump is also a Democrat with a R after his name and you will get most of what you want without the baggage and win long term. 

Think long term my Democrat friends.

You will win this election no matter who wins. 

Trump is the greatest gift to democrats in American history if you look at the big picture of what he has done and will do if elected again.",Wed Oct 30 19:23:36 +0000 2024,0.10531717658122157,Support

I don't want Trump to win with all my heart

But your strategy of scaring pro-Palestinians into voting for Harris by claiming Trump will be worse for Gaza does NOT work (I've tried)

Focus on pressing Harris to say 6 words ""As president, I'll end Gaza's war""

Pro-Palestinian voters find it condescending, offensive, & meaningless when told ""don't be single issue voters, think of our democracy's/climate's survival"", or ""Harris will let Israel kill slightly fewer Palestinians than Trump.""

Is butchering 100 Gazan children, women & civilians a day ""better"" than slaughtering 1,000 per day? Mathematically maybe, but brutal calculus is NOT how our human minds & hearts work.

Many folks I talked to say they cannot bring themselves to vote for Harris no matter how much they try. It feels to them like pressing a button to drop bombs & rain bullets on their own people in Gaza, & they can't handle the guilt. So they choose to vote third party or sit this election out.

I tried to make the point that every friend, loved one & family member I speak to in Gazans is frightened of a Trump presidency. I tried to remind people how Trump would allow Israel to permanently annex major chunks of Gaza; build settlements there; annex most of the West Bank; starve Gazans to death; collapse the PA & UNRWA; resume 2,000 pound bombs to Israel to rain on Gaza like candy...

It does't work! Genocide is the peak moment of ugliness that most people cannot possibly conceive anything worse!

If you really think Harris' presidency is crucial for the fight against climate change, for democracy, for women's rights or any other cause you believe in, then use all your energy to pressure her campaign to change course on the blank cheque to Israel to commit a livestreamed genocide!

The majority of Americans are in favor of ending the war on Gaza & even halting arm sales to Israel.

Isn't it selfish of Harris to sabotage her own campaign, to risk the future of our planet, to risk women's fundamental rights, just to appease her pals at AIPAC & co?",Wed Oct 30 19:07:36 +0000 2024,0.06849647266313932,Support

We‚Äôve surveyed over 3.5 million Americans. Over 200,000 of them are Pennsylvania voters. Here‚Äôs the results:

üî¥ Donald Trump - 78.4%
üîµ Kamala Harris - 21.6%

Voting is still underway, however with Republicans leading in early voting, these numbers look more and more accurate by the day.

Here‚Äôs the top 3 issues that matter most to voters in the Keystone State:

1. Inflation. 

Voters say that the prices of every day necessities have gotten way too high. Some participants said that they‚Äôre working multiple jobs just to pay for things like groceries and gasoline.

2. The Border. 

Residence of Pennsylvania explained how the southern border has impacted their day to day lives. They claim crime is rampant, homeless is out of control, and their democratic leadership is doing nothing to fix these issues.

3. Fracking. 

Fracking provides tens of thousands of jobs for people in the keystone state, and Kamala Harris past comments of wanting to ban fracking has became a huge concern.

We conducted these surveys and gathered this data through https://t.co/FtUaRwZmRQ.

It Is Not Pretty.

       In their false bravado over another Trump term. Some Trump insiders have made clear what they will do if Trump should win. Another Trump term promises mass suffering and pain for millions of Americans. From crashing the strongest economy in the world in order to replace it with a ‚Äúdoge‚Äù economy to allowing an anti vaccine anti medical zealot to be 100% in charge of our entire health and agriculture system to a quisling and fully compliant Speaker of the House who will carry out the plans of Donald Trump with zero pushback.  Another Trump term promises mass suffering and death for millions of Americans. 

           Elon Musk who Trump has promised will be put in charge of manufacturing and America‚Äôs economic future has said Americans will suffer ‚Äúhardship‚Äù under  a Trump economy. From the tariffs that will put a 20% surcharge on all foreign goods to an attempt to end the federal income tax and replace it with a tariff based national sales tax. Americans will suffer under a Donald Trump economy.  His top economic advisor Elon Musk promises as much. 

         Not only will Americans feel the pain of crashing the greatest economy in history in order to rebuild our economy into a ‚ÄúDOGE‚Äù economy that will rely on crypto while diminishing the power of the American dollar. Our health is at great risk if Trump is elected. At his MSG Hate Rally in New York Trump promised that he would allow RFK Jr to ‚Äú Go Crazy‚Äù with our health system. And our very lives. Following that comment Kennedy wasted no time in explaining what that would look like.

      According to Kennedy, Trump has promised to put him 100% in charge of our health and medical system that is the envy of the world.  That would allow Kennedy to take charge of HHS , FDA, CDC and even the USDA.  Kennedy would have absolute control over everything from pharmaceuticals to our food supply and everything in between. While Americans are still fighting against multiple childhood diseases, cancers and Covid. The anti- vaccine zealot RFK Jr would bring an end to childhood vaccines and even eliminate such vital medical necessities as Covid and Flu shots. Most medical research and new breakthroughs in medical treatments would come to a screeching halt. People will die. America cannot afford RFK Jr in charge of the nations health. It will be deadly. Just ask the families of 83 American Samoan children who died after their families refused to vaccinate their children based on the word of RFK Jr.  This is a risk we must not take. 

      And finally we come to Speaker MAGA Mike Johnson who said the quite part out loud about the ACA. Johnson promised  to end the Affordable Care Act if Trump is elected and he remains Speaker. ( then said ‚Äúshush that‚Äôs a secret) . This will only be one of the many dangerous changes Trump and Johnson promise if they are elected. From refusing to feed hungry children to ending Social Security ( that will be ended in 6 years if Trump is elected)  The combination of a Republican House and Trump White House will be disastrous for the American people. 

     There is only one way to avoid the disaster outlined above. Elect Kamala Harris  and soundly defeat Donald Trump and House Republicans. Mike Johnson must never be Speaker of the House and Donald Trump must never be president.  The future of America depends on it.

This is why they'll easily gravitate towards conspiracy theories and call the election a fraud.
Keeping people ignorant is dangerous, and it shows that their own party can't trust their own people with cold hard facts.
One of the main reasons they keep their people in the dark about issues is because it's easier to manipulate them.
The immigration issue is one prime example - they use it as a scare tactic.  The way they handle it is the equivalent of being in a dark forest without a light.  They'll hear rustling in the brush, they'll start rumors of it being a bear and panic breaks out.
""There is a giant bear hunting us! It's going to kill us all!!""
This will continue on and compound their paranoia - going on and on because no one has the common sense to start a fire or get a flashlight to see what the rustling is.
And when they do? ""Oh shit, it was just a rabbit.""
Just like all of the lines of people at the US border, people freaking out about the lines of people trying to enter the country legally.  Yes that's right - those lines you see of women and children at the border are all legally trying to get into the USA.
Keeping people ignorant and in the dark works to the republican's advantage.  They work off of people's fears, stoke the fires of hatred - they've been doing this for a long time.  They're so used to it they can't even recognize it happening anymore.  Trump just magnified their fears and says what they want to hear - critical thinking be damned.
That's why this election is so dangerous.  That's why every single abled bodied adult needs to get up off their asses and vote.
Fear is an illusion.

Harris wins   (and certainly has value +200)

For the last month, I have been telling  all I believe Trump will win, and to look to bet Trump as a small favorite.

Based on the LASTEST CURRENT INFO:

I think Harris can SWEEP the Blue Wall winning Wisconsin/Mich/Pa all by small amounts.    

She loses all the other swing states......  Harris 270.  MAGA 268.   

 Pa takes FOREVER to recount as it is decided by such a small amount.

Joe said the same thing in 2020.
We saw how that worked out.

Harris is afraid to reveal her true agenda, the one beneath the hologram campaign about nothing but handouts.

She has the anti-Orange vote locked up, with Liz Cheney at the tip of the poisonous spear.

She has a group of 200 + who worked for Presidents George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, as well as Trump haters Romney and the late Sen. John McCain.

‚ú®Kamala‚ú®the chosen has a zillion dollar war cache 
fit for a queen ‚Äîa queen who plans to use it on strategic foreign wars.

Harris has the full-throated support of the press, the force of the 2016 election denier 
Old Guard in the military industrial complex.

The ‚ÄòGet Trump‚Äô intelligentsia and their beltway buddies are all stacked in Harris‚Äô camp. 

Along with Big Pharma, Big climate change, Big Science and Big HealthCare,
the lords of big tech, Wall Street moneybags, Hollywood celebs, and many more.

Hope and Joy ‚Äîthe sequel to Hope and Change is alive in Harris‚Äô presidential campaign.

2. Biden can‚Äôt communicate coherently. At all. So he shouldn‚Äôt be speaking. At all.

3. Kamala Harris has been nothing but gracious toward Trump supporters. She wants to be President for ALL Americans. She‚Äôs done nothing but preach unity, ending the hate, being respectful, and finding common ground between the two sides.

4. Trump is the greatest purveyor of hate in American politics today. Every single word out of his mouth is hate, fear, & division. Been that way for years.

5. So Trump supporters, quit whining about Biden. You‚Äôve eagerly embraced the guy who said his political opponents are evil, who said they‚Äôre the ‚Äúenemy within,‚Äù who just today said they‚Äôre ‚Äúhorrible people,‚Äù and who said he‚Äôll use the military to go after his political opponents.
