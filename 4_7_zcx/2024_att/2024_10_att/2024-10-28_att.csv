Kamala Harris spent 50 billion dollars to hook up a small population of the country to the internet 

Not one person got hooked up

Starlink

The End

Stupidity must stop, don‚Äôt vote on ur fkng dumb personal feelings

If u have personal feelings shove them up ur ass they 90% most likely wrong 

Vote on math, science, and the ability to hook up the entire country to the internet would literally be the best achievement any President has ever made

I say this to not based on my emotion, say this as someone who live in his car outside of a library

Bet on the smartest human being we have on this planet that‚Äôs a good bet

Trump supporters went first. ‚ÄúWe sold hand tools: hammers, screwdrivers, crescent wrenches, sockets etc. and made $347.00 dollars.

We explained to our customers that If they invested their money in tools, they would be able to use them to work hard and make good money. They could be self-independent, support their family and be proud Americans.‚Äù

Here's a reality check for you, Al:

üî• Tawana Brawley Hoax: Remember when Sharpton supported a woman who falsely accused four white men of kidnapping and raping her? She was found covered in feces in a trash bag, and despite overwhelming evidence, Sharpton stood by her, leading to lawsuits and a tarnished reputation for the falsely accused. 
üî• Crown Heights Riot: In 1991, Sharpton's inflammatory rhetoric during the Crown Heights riot, where he marched with a sign reading ""No Justice, No Peace,"" directly contributed to days of violence, including the death of Yankel Rosenbaum, a Jewish student, amidst chants of ""Kill the Jew.""
üî• Freddy's Fashion Mart Incident (1995): Sharpton was criticized for his involvement in protests against Freddy's Fashion Mart in Harlem. The protests, which followed the store's Jewish owners evicting a black sub-tenant for non-payment of rent, turned violent. A protestor eventually set the store on fire, leading to eight deaths. Sharpton was accused of inflaming racial tensions with his rhetoric during this event.
üî• Duke Lacrosse Case (2006): Sharpton initially supported the accuser in the Duke University lacrosse team rape case, which later fell apart due to inconsistencies in her story and lack of physical evidence. He marched with Jesse Jackson in Durham to support her claims, which were eventually discredited.
üî• Trayvon Martin Case (2012): Sharpton led protests and was a visible figure in the media during the aftermath of Trayvon Martin's shooting. His involvement was criticized by some for potentially escalating racial tensions and for his initial portrayal of the incident as racially motivated, which was a complex issue debated in court.

üî• Disgusting Quotes: 
1. ""White folks was in the caves while we was building empires."" - This quote has been criticized for promoting racial division by suggesting a simplistic and historically inaccurate view of racial superiority.
2. ""If the Jews want to get it on, tell them to pin their yarmulkes back and come over to my house."" - Said during the Crown Heights riots, this quote was seen as inflammatory and contributing to racial and religious tensions.
3. On the Tawana Brawley case: ""I will not accept any guilt for Tawana Brawley. I did what any leader would do... I believed my client."" - This statement has been critiqued for his refusal to acknowledge the hoax even after it was debunked, showing a lack of accountability.
4. On the Duke Lacrosse case: Initially, he supported the accuser, saying, ""It's time to take a stand,"" without full evidence, which later turned out to be a false accusation. This involvement has been criticized for rushing to judgment based on racial lines.
5. ""ALL WHITE PEOPLE ARE BORN RACIST, AND ALL THESE COPS KILLING OUR OWN IS PROOF OF THAT.""- AL SHARPTON MSNBC

Sharpton has been criticized for racial baiting, leading protests based on false premises, and his association with controversial figures like Don King, all while claiming to fight for justice.

Think about this--jury selection would be set to start end of this week as Kamala Harris, Democrats, and the media make J6 and threats of political violence if Trump doesn't win the closing pitch.

While Moss played dumb to provable concerns over jury influence pre and post election--""doesn't make any sense to me"" LOL--he said the quiet part out loud.

Several states have laws barring them from assigning their electors until ALL counties have certified, and if enough states hold back their electors and neither Trump nor Harris get to the required 270, the decision gets moved into the MAGA-controlled House of Representatives, where each state gets one vote regardless of population‚Ä¶and Donald Trump wins due to the fact there‚Äôs more red states than blue.  

It‚Äôs similar to what they‚Äôd ultimately hoped might happen in 2020 if Pence had illegally refused to certify, and they‚Äôve spent the last 3+ years making sure nothing stands in their way this time around.

If gave two shits about any of crypto he would have talked about it on Joe Rogan's podcast, but he didn't  even mention his own recently launched project because it was such an embarrassing failure. Even Trump haters didn't imagine how much of an dogshit grift that turned to be.

He got 150% of the TOP end budget he presented during his election campaign. Besides that, the wall was a waste of money as illegal immigration was surging at the end of Trump's term and during the first few months of Biden's (before he enacted any policies to make the problem even worse).

""I will eliminate income tax and substitute it with tariffs.""

No he won't. And no one who is parroting this incredibly absurd policy proposal has even the slightest clue about how much tariffs would need to be set to in order to eliminate the income tax and working towards a balanced the budget.

He's leveraging his status as some supposedly well-respected political scientist to decide who belongs within the boundaries of legitimate political discourse and who doesn‚Äôt.

But in doing so, Sabato is actually intensifying the very divide he regularly decries. By declaring Trump‚Äôs supporters as anathema and linking them to the Nazis, he's explicitly casting them as a kind of existential threat. 

And when you treat a political opponent as something to be feared, something beyond the pale, you leave no room for engagement or dialogue.

This is precisely how otherwise normal political divisions deepen into open hostility. One side feels persecuted by another which claims to merely be fighting for ""basic human decency"" when, in reality, they're pushing for their own explicitly political ends.

As Carl Schmitt once said, ""Whoever invokes humanity wants to cheat.""

Sabato's unhinged diatribes on Twitter reveal that all attempts to pretend there is a ""neutral"" objective center ultimately only heighten division because it deludes people into thinking they‚Äôre above the political. 

But no one really is.

When ""experts"" like Sabato disguise their rampant partisanship as impartial commentary and thoughtful observation, they create an illusion of moral superiority by casting the other side as irrational, dangerous, or even outright evil. 

He claims to fear extreme, divisive rhetoric, all while simultaneously fueling the exact conditions that are making real hostility inevitable.
